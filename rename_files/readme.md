rename.py
=========

This script is for renaming files based on a metadata table. 

It expects the following data: first, a number of files that have an identifier (for example a number or code, such as "ab1234") for their file name. Second, a table in CSV format that has one row per file and metadata about the file in the columns (for example, information about the date, author, title of the document contained in the file).
