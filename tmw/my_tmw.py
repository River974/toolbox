### Usage ###
# 0. Make sure you have Python3, TreeTagger and Mallet installed.
# 1. Make sure all necessary files are in the working directory
# 2. Set working directory below
# 3. Select series of functions below by un-commenting them as needed
# 4. Set parameters for each function.
# 5. Run the workflow.
