toolbox
=======

Collection of small tools for text processing. Each folder contains one or several functions and some sample texts for testing.

* folder "ingest" is for functions that help creating TEI files. 
* folder "extract" is for functions that extract text from TEI files. 
* folder "rename" is for functions that rename files. 
* folder "split" is for functions that help with splitting texts in smaller chunks.

Note that all functions are designed for Python 3 and are experimental in nature and quality.
