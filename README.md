Collection of small tools for text processing. Each folder contains one or several Python scripts and some sample texts for testing.

* ana2csv: transforms TEI files annotated with @ana to a CSV format.
* cleanup: performs some search-and-replace as preprocessing for Topic Modeling
* copy_subset: Script to create subsets of files from a file collection based on metadata.
* extract: scripts to extract selected text from TEI files. 
* ingest: scripts that help creating TEI files from HTML. 
* rename: scripts that help rename files based on metadata. 
* split: scripts that help with splitting texts in smaller chunks.
* trt2txt: takes TreeTagger output and writes lemmas to plain text file. 

Note that all functions are designed for Python 3 and are experimental in nature and quality.
