, who be usually very late in the morning , save upon those not infrequent occasion when he be up all night , be seat at the breakfast table . i stand upon the hearth-rug and pick up the stick which our visitor have leave behind him the night before . it be a fine , thick piece of wood , , of the sort which be know as a " lawyer . " just under the head be a broad silver band nearly an inch across . " to , , from his friend of the , " be engrave upon it , with the date " @card@ . " it be just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner use to , solid , and reassuring . " well , , what do you make of it ? " be sit with his back to me , and i have give him no sign of my occupation . " how do you know what i be do ? i believe you have eye in the back of your head . " " i have , at least , a , silver-plate in front of me , " say he . " but , tell me , , what do you make of our visitor 's stick ? since we have be so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand , this accidental souvenir become of importance . let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it . " " i think , " say i , follow as far as i could the method of my companion , " that be a successful , elderly medical man , since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation . " " good ! " say . " excellent ! " " i think also that the probability be in favour of his be a country practitioner who do a great deal of his visit on foot . " " why so ? " " because this stick , though originally a very handsome one have be so knock about that i can hardly imagine a town practitioner carry it . the ferrule be wear down , so it be evident that he have do a great amount of walk with it . " " perfectly sound ! " say . " and then again , there be the ' friend of the ' i should guess that to be the something , the local hunt to whose member he have possibly give some surgical assistance , and which have make him a small presentation in return . " " really , , you excel yourself , " say , push back his chair and light a cigarette . " i be bind to say that in all the account which you have be so good as to give of my own small achievement you have habitually underrate your own ability . it may be that you be not yourself luminous , but you be a conductor of light . some people without possess genius have a remarkable power of stimulate it . i confess , my dear fellow , that i be very much in your debt . " he have never say as much before , and i must admit that his word give me keen pleasure , for i have often be pique by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempt which i have make to give publicity to his method . i be proud , too , to think that i have so far master his system as to apply it in a way which earn his approval . he now take the stick from my hand and examine it for a few minute with his naked eye . then with an expression of interest he lay down his cigarette , and carry the cane to the window , he look over it again with a convex lens . " interesting , though elementary , " say he as he return to his favourite corner of the settee . " there be certainly one or two indication upon the stick . it give us the basis for several deduction . " " have anything escape me ? " i ask with some self-importance . " i trust that there be nothing of consequence which i have overlook ? " " i be afraid , my dear , that most of your conclusion be erroneous . when i say that you stimulate me i mean , to be frank , that in note your fallacy i be occasionally guide towards the truth . not that you be entirely wrong in this instance . the man be certainly a country practitioner . and he walk a good deal . " " then i be right . " " to that extent . " " but that be all . " " no , no , my dear , not no mean all . i would suggest , for example , that a presentation to a doctor be more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt , and that when the initial ' ' be place before that hospital the word ' ' very naturally suggest themselves . " " you may be right . " " the probability lie in that direction . and if we take this as a work hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor . " " well , then , suppose that ' ' do stand for ' , ' what further inference may we draw ? " " do none suggest themselves ? you know my method . apply them ! " " i can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man have practise in town before go to the country . " " i think that we might venture a little farther than this . look at it in this light . on what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be make ? when would his friend unite to give him a pledge of their good will ? obviously at the moment when withdraw from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself . we know there have be a presentation . we believe there have be a change from a town hospital to a country practice . be it , then , stretch our inference too far to say that the presentation be on the occasion of the change ? " " it certainly seem probable . " " now , you will observe that he could not have be on the staff of the hospital , since only a man well-established in a practice could hold such a position , and such a one would not drift into the country . what be he , then ? if he be in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have be a or a more than a senior student . and he leave five year date be on the stick . so your grave , middle-aged family practitioner vanish into thin air , my dear , and there emerge a young fellow under thirty , amiable , unambitious , absent-minded , and the possessor of a favourite dog , which i should describe roughly as be large than a terrier and small than a mastiff . " i laugh incredulously as lean back in his settee and blow little waver ring of smoke up to the ceiling . " as to the latter part , i have no means of check you , " say i , " but at least it be not difficult to find out a few particular about the man 's age and professional career . " from my small medical shelf i take down the and turn up the name . there be several , but only one who could be our visitor . i read his record aloud . " , , , @card@ , , , . , from @card@ to @card@ , at . winner of the prise for , with essay entitle ' be a reversion ? ' member of the . author of ' some of ' ( @card@ ) . ' do we progress ? ' ( of , , @card@ ) . for the parish of , , and . " " no mention of that local hunt , , " say with a mischievous smile , " but a country doctor , as you very astutely observe . i think that i be fairly justify in my inference . as to the adjective , i say , if i remember right , amiable , unambitious , and absent-minded . it be my experience that it be only an amiable man in this world who receive testimonial , only an unambitious one who abandon a career for the country , and only an absent-minded one who leave his stick and not his after wait an hour in your room . " " and the dog ? " " have be in the habit of carry this stick behind his master . be a heavy stick the dog have hold it tightly by the middle , and the mark of his tooth be very plainly visible . the dog 's jaw , as show in the space between these mark , be too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff . it may have , by , it be a curly-haired spaniel . " he have rise and pace the room as he speak . now he halt in the recess of the window . there be such a ring of conviction in his voice that i glance up in surprise . " my dear fellow , how can you possibly be so sure of that ? " " for the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our very , and there be the ring of its owner . do n't move , i beg you , . he be a professional brother of yours , and your presence may be of assistance to me . now be the dramatic moment of fate , , when you hear a step upon the stair which be walk into your life , and you know not whether for good or ill . what do , the man of science , ask of , the specialist in crime ? come in ! " the appearance of our visitor be a surprise to me , since i have expect a typical country practitioner . he be a very tall , thin man , with a long nose like a beak , which jut out between two keen , gray eye , set closely together and sparkle brightly from behind a pair of glass . he be clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion , for his frock-coat be dingy and his trouser fray . though young , his long back be already bow , and he walk with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peer benevolence . as he enter his eye fall upon the stick in 's hand , and he run towards it with an exclamation of joy . " i be so very glad , " say he . " i be not sure whether i have leave it here or in the . i would not lose that stick for the world . " " a presentation , i see , " say . " yes , sir . " " from ? " " from one or two friend there on the occasion of my marriage . " " , dear , that be bad ! " say , shake his head . blink through his glass in mild astonishment . " why be it bad ? " " only that you have disarrange our little deduction . your marriage , you say ? " " yes , sir . i marry , and so leave the hospital , and with it all hope of a consulting practice . it be necessary to make a home of my own . " " come , come , we be not so far wrong , after all , " say . " and now , -- " " , sir , humble " " and a man of precise mind , evidently . " " a dabbler in science , , a picker up of shell on the shore of the great unknown ocean . i presume that it be whom i be address and -- " " no , this be my friend . " " glad to meet you , sir . i have hear your name mention in connection with that of your friend . you interest me very much , . i have hardly expect so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked development . would you have any objection to my run my finger along your parietal fissure ? a cast of your skull , sir , until the original be available , would be an ornament to any anthropological museum . it be not my intention to be fulsome , but i confess that i covet your skull . " wave our strange visitor into a chair . " you be an enthusiast in your line of thought , i perceive , sir , as i be in mine , " say he . " i observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarette . have no hesitation in light one . " the man draw out paper and tobacco and twirl the one up in the other with surprising dexterity . he have long , quiver finger as agile and restless as the antenna of an insect . be silent , but his little dart glance show me the interest which he take in our curious companion . " i presume , sir , " say he at last , " that it be not merely for the purpose of examine my skull that you have do me the honour to call here last night and again today ? " " no , sir , no ; though i be happy to have have the opportunity of do that as well . i come to you , , because i recognize that i be myself an unpractical man and because i be suddenly confront with a most serious and extraordinary problem . recognize , as i do , that you be the second high expert in -- " " indeed , sir ! may i inquire who have the honour to be the first ? " ask with some asperity . " to the man of precisely scientific mind the work of monsieur must always appeal strongly . " " then have you not well consult him ? " " i say , sir , to the precisely scientific mind . but as a practical man of affair it be acknowledged that you stand alone . i trust , sir , that i have not -- " " just a little , " say . " i think , , you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem be in which you demand my assistance . " " i have in my pocket a manuscript , " say . " i observe it as you enter the room , " say . " it be an old manuscript . " " early eighteenth century , unless it be a forgery . " " how can you say that , sir ? " " you have present an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have be talk . it would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so . you may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject . i put that at @card@ . " " the exact date be @card@ . " draw it from his . " this family paper be commit to my care by , whose sudden and tragic death some three month ago create so much excitement in . i may say that i be his personal friend as well as his medical attendant . he be a strong-minded man , sir , shrewd , practical , and as unimaginative as i be myself . yet he take this document very seriously , and his mind be prepare for just such an end as do eventually overtake him . " stretch out his hand for the manuscript and flatten it upon his knee . " you will observe , , the alternative use of the long s and the short . it be one of several indication which enable me to fix the date . " i look over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the fade script . at the head be write : " , " and below in large , scrawl figure : " @card@ . " " it appear to be a statement of some sort . " " yes , it be a statement of a certain legend which run in the family . " " but i understand that it be something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me ? " " most modern . a most practical , pressing matter , which must be decide within hour . but the manuscript be short and be intimately connect with the affair . with your permission i will read it to you . " lean back in his chair , place his together , and close his eye , with an air of resignation . turn the manuscript to the light and read in a high , crack voice the follow curious , old-world narrative : " of the origin of the hound of the there have be many statement , yet as i come in a direct line from , and as i have the story from my father , who also have it from his , i have set it down with all belief that it occur even as be here set forth . and i would have you believe , my son , that the same justice which punish sin may also most graciously forgive it , and that no ban be so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be remove . learn then from this story not to fear the fruit of the past , but rather to be circumspect in the future , that those foul passion whereby our family have suffer so grievously may not again be loose to our undoing . " know then that in the time of the ( the history of which by the learn i most earnestly commend to your attention ) this of be hold by of that name , nor can it be gainsay that he be a most wild , profane , and godless man . this , in truth , his neighbour might have pardon , see that saint have never flourish in those part , but there be in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which make his name a through the . it chance that this come to love ( if , indeed , so dark a passion may be know under so bright a name ) the daughter of a yeoman who hold land near the estate . but the young maiden , be discreet and of good repute , would ever avoid him , for she fear his evil name . so it come to pass that one michaelmas this , with five or six of his idle and wicked companion , steal down upon the farm and carry off the maiden , her father and brother being from home , as he well know . when they have bring her to the the maiden be place in an upper chamber , while and his friend sit down to a long carouse , as be their nightly custom . now , the poor lass upstairs be like to have her wit turn at the singing and shouting and terrible oath which come up to her from below , for they say that the word use by , when he be in wine , be such as might blast the man who say them . at last in the stress of her fear she do that which might have daunt the brave or most active man , for by the aid of the growth of ivy which cover ( and still cover ) the south wall she come down from under the eaves , and so homeward across the moor , there be three league betwixt the and her father 's farm . " it chance that some little time later leave his guest to carry food and other worse thing , his captive , and so find the cage empty and the bird escape . then , as it would seem , he become as one that have a devil , for , rush down the stair into the , he spring upon the great table , flagon and trencher fly before him , and he cry aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the of if he might but overtake the wench . and while the reveller stand aghast at the fury of the man , one more wicked or , it may be , more drunken than the rest , cry out that they should put the hound upon her . whereat run from the house , cry to his groom that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack , and give the hound a kerchief of the maid be , he swing them to the line , and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor . " now , for some space the reveller stand agape , unable to understand all that have be do in such haste . but anon their bemused wit awake to the nature of the deed which be like to be do upon the moorland . everything be now in an uproar , some calling for their pistol , some for their horse , and some for another flask of wine . but at length some sense come back to their crazed mind , and the whole of them , thirteen in number , take horse and start in pursuit . the moon shine clear above them , and they ride swiftly abreast , take that course which the maid must needs have take if she be to reach her own home . " they have go a mile or two when they pass one of the night shepherd upon the moorland , and they cry to him to know if he have see the hunt . and the man , as the story go , be so craze with fear that he could scarce speak , but at last he say that he have indeed see the unhappy maiden , with the hound upon her track . ' but i have see more than that , ' say he , ' for pass me upon his black mare , and there run mute behind him such a hound of hell as forbid should ever be at my heel . ' so the drunken squire curse the shepherd and ride onward . but soon their skin turn cold , for there come a gallop across the moor , and the black mare , dabble with white froth , go past with trail bridle and empty saddle . then the reveller ride close together , for a great fear be on them , but they still follow over the moor , though each , have he be alone , would have be right glad to have turn his horse 's head . ride slowly in this fashion they come at last upon the hound . these , though know for their valour and their breed , be whimper in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or , as we call it , upon the moor , some slink away and some , with start hackle and stare eye , gaze down the narrow valley before them . " the company have come to a halt , more sober man , as you may guess , than when they start . the most of them would by no means advance , but three of them , the bold , or it may be the most drunken , ride forward down the . now , it open into a broad space in which stand two of those great stone , still to be see there , which be set by certain forget people in the day of old . the moon be shine bright upon the clearing , and there in the centre lie the unhappy maid where she have fall , dead of fear and of fatigue . but it be not the sight of her body , nor yet be it that of the body of lie near her , which raise the hair upon the head of these three dare-devil , but it be that , stand over , and pluck at his throat , there stand a foul thing , a great , black beast , shape like a hound , yet large than any hound that ever mortal eye have rest upon . and even as they look the thing tear the throat out of , on which , as it turn its blaze eye and drip jaw upon them , the three shriek with fear and ride for dear life , still scream , across the moor . one , it be say , die that very night of what he have see , and the other twain be but break man for the rest of their day . " such be the tale , my son , of the come of the hound which be say to have plague the family so sorely ever since . if i have set it down it be because that which be clearly known have less terror than that which be but hint at and guess . nor can it be deny that many of the family have be unhappy in their death , which have be sudden , bloody , and mysterious . yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of , which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which be threaten in . to that , my son , i hereby commend you , and i counsel you by way of caution to forbear from cross the moor in those dark hour when the power of evil be exalt . " [ from to his son and , with instruction that they say nothing thereof to their sister . ] " when have finish read this singular narrative he push his spectacle up on his forehead and stare across at . the latter yawn and toss the end of his cigarette into the fire . " well ? " say he . " do you not find it interesting ? " " to a collector of fairy tale . " draw a fold newspaper out of his pocket . " now , , we will give you something a little more recent . this be the of 14th of this year . it be a short account of the fact elicit at the death of which occur a few day before that date . " my friend lean a little forward and his expression become intent . our visitor readjust his glass and begin : " the recent sudden death of , whose name have be mention as the probable liberal candidate for at the next election , have cast a gloom over the county . though have reside at for a comparatively short period his amiability of character and extreme generosity have win the affection and respect of all who have be bring into contact with him . in these day of rich it be refresh to find a case where the scion of an old county family which have fall upon evil day be able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fall grandeur of his line . , as be well know , make large sum of money in south african speculation . more wise than those who go on until the wheel turn against them , he realize his gain and return to with them . it be only two year since he take up his residence at , and it be common talk how large be those scheme of reconstruction and improvement which have be interrupt by his death . being himself childless , it be his openly express desire that the whole countryside should , within his own lifetime , profit by his good fortune , and many will have personal reason for bewail his untimely end . his generous donation to local and county charity have be frequently chronicle in these column . " the circumstance connect with the death of can be say to have be entirely clear up by the inquest , but at least enough have be do to dispose of those rumour to which local superstition have give rise . there be no reason whatever to suspect foul play , or to imagine that death could be from any but natural cause . be a widower , and a man who may be say to have be in some way of an eccentric habit of mind . in spite of his considerable wealth he be simple in his personal taste , and his indoor servant at consist of a married couple name , the husband act as butler and the wife as housekeeper . their evidence , corroborate by that of several friend , tend to show that 's health have for some time be impair , and point especially to some affection of the heart , manifest itself in change of colour , breathlessness , and acute attack of nervous depression . , the friend and medical attendant of the deceased , have give evidence to the same effect . " the fact of the case be simple . be in the habit every night before go to bed of walk down the famous yew alley of . the evidence of the show that this have be his custom . on the fourth of have declare his intention of start next day for , and have order to prepare his luggage . that night he go out as usual for his nocturnal walk , in the course of which he be in the habit of smoke a cigar . he never return . at twelve o'clock , find the hall door still open , become alarm , and , light a lantern , go in search of his master . the day have be wet , and 's footmark be easily trace down the alley . halfway down this walk there be a gate which lead out on to the moor . there be indication that have stand for some little time here . he then proceed down the alley , and it be at the far end of it that his body be discover . one fact which have not be explain be the statement of that his master 's footprint alter their character from the time that he pass the , and that he appear from thence onward to have be walk upon his toe . , a gipsy , be on the moor at no great distance at the time , but he appear by his own confession to have be the bad for drink . he declare that he hear cry but be unable to state from what direction they come . no sign of violence be to be discover upon 's person , and though the doctor 's evidence point to an almost incredible facial great that refuse at first to believe that it be indeed his friend and patient who lie before be explain that that be a symptom which be not unusual in case of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion . this explanation be bear out by the post-mortem examination , which show long-standing organic disease , and the coroner 's jury return a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence . it be well that this be so , for it be obviously of the utmost importance that 's heir should settle at the and continue the good work which have be so sadly interrupt . have the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic storey which have be whisper in connection with the affair , it might have be difficult to find a tenant for . it be understand that the next of kin be , if he be still alive , the son of 's young brother . the young man when last hear of be in , and inquiry be be institute with a view to inform him of his good fortune . " his paper and replace it in his pocket . " those be the public fact , , in connection with the death of . " " i must thank you , " say , " for call my attention to a case which certainly present some feature of interest . i have observe some newspaper comment at the time , but i be exceedingly preoccupy by that little affair of the vatican cameo , and in my anxiety to oblige the i lose touch with several interesting english case . this article , you say , contain all the public fact ? " " it do . " " then let me have the private one . " he lean back , put his together , and assume his most impassive and judicial expression . " in do so , " say , who have begin to show sign of some strong emotion , " i be tell that which i have not confide to anyone . my motive for withhold it from the coroner 's inquiry be that a man of science shrink from place himself in the public position of seem to indorse a popular superstition . i have the further motive that , as the paper say , would certainly remain if anything be do to increase its already rather grim reputation . for both these reason i think that i be justify in tell rather less than i know , since no practical good could result from it , but with you there be no reason why i should not be perfectly frank . " the moor be very sparsely inhabit , and those who live near each other be throw very much together . for this reason i see a good deal of . with the exception of , of , and , the naturalist , there be no other man of education within many mile . be a retire man , but the chance of his illness bring us together , and a community of interest in science keep us so . he have bring back much scientific information from , and many a charming evening we have spend together discuss the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the . " within the last few month it become increasingly plain to me that 's nervous system be strain to the breaking point . he have take this legend which i have read you exceedingly to much so that , although he would walk in his own ground , nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night . incredible as it may appear to you , , he be honestly convince that a dreadful fate overhang his family , and certainly the record which he be able to give of his ancestor be not encouraging . the idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunt him , and on more than one occasion he have ask me whether i have on my medical journey at night ever see any strange creature or hear the bay of a hound . the latter question he put to me several time , and always with a voice which vibrate with excitement . " i can well remember drive up to his house in the evening some three week before the fatal event . he chance to be at his hall door . i have descend from my gig and be stand in front of him , when i see his eye fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror . i whisk round and have just time to catch a glimpse of something which i take to be a large black calf pass at the head of the drive . so excited and alarmed be he that i be compel to go down to the spot where the animal have be and look around for it . it be go , however , and the incident appear to make the bad impression upon his mind . i stay with him all the evening , and it be on that occasion , to explain the emotion which he have show , that he confide to my keep that narrative which i read to you when first i come . i mention this small episode because it assume some importance in view of the tragedy which follow , but i be convince at the time that the matter be entirely trivial and that his excitement have no justification . " it be at my advice that be about to go to . his heart be , i know , affect , and the constant anxiety in which he live , however chimerical the cause of it might be , be evidently have a serious effect upon his health . i think that a few month among the distraction of town would send him back a new man . , a mutual friend who be much concern at his state of health , be of the same opinion . at the last instant come this terrible catastrophe . " on the night of 's death the butler , who make the discovery , send the groom on horseback to me , and as i be sit up late i be able to reach within an hour of the event . i check and corroborate all the fact which be mention at the inquest . i follow the footstep down the yew alley , i see the spot at the where he seem to have wait , i remark the change in the shape of the print after that point , i note that there be no other footstep save those of on the soft gravel , and finally i carefully examine the body , which have not be touch until my arrival . lie on his face , his arm out , his finger dig into the ground , and his feature convulse with some strong emotion to such an extent that i could hardly have swear to his identity . there be certainly no physical injury of any kind . but one false statement be make by at the inquest . he say that there be no trace upon the ground round the body . he do not observe any . but i little distance off , but fresh and clear . " " footprint ? " " footprint . " " a man 's or a woman 's ? " look strangely at us for an instant , and his voice sink almost to a whisper as he answer . " , they be the footprint of a gigantic hound ! " i confess at these word a shudder pass through me . there be a thrill in the doctor 's voice which show that he be himself deeply move by that which he tell us . lean forward in his excitement and his eye have the hard , dry glitter which shoot from them when he be keenly interested . " you see this ? " " as clearly as i see you . " " and you say nothing ? " " what be the use ? " " how be it that no one else see it ? " " the mark be some twenty yard from the body and no one give them a think . i do n't suppose i should have do so have i not know this legend . " " there be many on the moor ? " " no doubt , but this be no . " " you say it be large ? " " enormous . " " but it have not approach the body ? " " no. " " what sort of night be it ? ' " damp and raw . " " but not actually rain ? " " no. " " what be the alley like ? " " there be two line of old yew hedge , twelve foot high and impenetrable . the walk in the centre be about eight foot across . " " be there anything between the hedge and the walk ? " " yes , there be a strip of grass about six foot broad on either side . " " i understand that the yew hedge be penetrate at one point by a gate ? " " yes , the wicket-gate which lead on to the moor . " " be there any other opening ? " " none . " " so that to reach the yew alley one either have to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the ? " " there be an exit through a summer-house at the far end . " " have reach this ? " " no ; he lie about fifty yard from it . " " now , tell me , this be mark which you see be on the path and not on the grass ? " " no mark could show on the grass . " " be they on the same side of the path as the ? " " yes ; they be on the edge of the path on the same side as the . " " you interest me exceedingly . another point . be the wicket-gate close ? " " close and padlock . " " how high be it ? " " about four foot high . " " then anyone could have get over it ? " " yes . " " and what mark do you see by the wicket-gate ? " " none in particular . " " good heaven ! do no one examine ? " " yes , i examine , myself . " " and find nothing ? " " it be all very confuse . have evidently stand there for five or ten minute . " " how do you know that ? " " because the ash have twice drop from his cigar . " " excellent ! this be a colleague , , after our own heart . but the mark ? " " he have leave his own mark all over that small patch of gravel . i could discern no other . " strike his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture . " if i have only be there ! " he cry . " it be evidently a case of extraordinary interest , and one which present immense opportunity to the scientific expert . that gravel page upon which i might have read so much have be long ere this smudge by the rain and deface by the clog of curious peasant . oh , , , to think that you should not have call me in ! you have indeed much to answer for . " " i could not call you in , , without disclose these fact to the world , and i have already give my reason for not wish to do so . besides , -- " " why do you hesitate ? " " there be a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detective be helpless . " " you mean that the thing be supernatural ? " " i do not positively say so . " " no , but you evidently think it . " " since the tragedy , , there have come to my ear several incident which be hard to reconcile with the settle order of . " " for example ? " " i find that before the terrible event occur several people have see a creature upon the moor which correspond with this demon , and which could not possibly be any animal know to science . they all agree that it be a huge creature , luminous , ghastly , and spectral . i have cross-examine these man , one of them a hard-headed countryman , one a farrier , and one a moorland farmer , who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition , exactly corresponding to the of the legend . i assure you that there be a reign of terror in the district , and that it be a hardy man who will cross the moor at night . " " and you , a trained man of science , believe it to be supernatural ? " " i do not know what to believe . " shrug his shoulder . " i have hitherto confine my investigation to this world , " say he . " in a modest way i have combat evil , but to take on the of himself would , perhaps , be too ambitious a task . yet you must admit that the footmark be material . " " the original hound be material enough to tug a man 's throat out , and yet he be diabolical as well . " " i see that you have quite go over to the supernaturalist . but now , , tell me this . if you hold these view , why have you come to consult me at all ? you tell me in the same breath that it be useless to investigate 's death , and that you desire me to do it . " " i do not say that i desire you to do it . " " then , how can i assist you ? " " by advise me as to what i should do with , who arrive at . look at his exactly one hour and a quarter . " " he be the heir ? " " yes . on the death of we inquire for this young gentleman and find that he have be farm in . from the account which have reach us he be an excellent fellow in every way . i speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of 's will . " " there be no other claimant , i presume ? " " none . the only other kinsman whom we have be able to trace be , the young of three brother of whom poor be the elder . the second brother , who die young , be the father of this lad . the third , , be the black sheep of the family . he come of the old masterful strain and be the very image , they tell me , of the family picture of old . he make too hot to hold him , flee to , and die there in @card@ of yellow fever . be the last of the . in one hour and five minute i meet him at . i have have a wire that he arrive at this morning . now , , what would you advise me to do with him ? " " why should he not go to the home of his father ? " " it seem natural , do it not ? and yet , consider that every who go there meet with an evil fate . i feel sure that if could have speak with me before his death he would have warn me against bring this , the last of the old race , and the heir to great wealth , to that deadly place . and yet it can be deny that the prosperity of the whole poor , bleak countryside depend upon his presence . all the good work which have be do by will crash to the ground if there be no tenant of the . i fear lest i should be sway too much by my own obvious interest in the matter , and that be why i bring the case before you and ask for your advice . " consider for a little time . " put into plain word , the matter be this , " say he . " in your opinion there be a diabolical agency which make an unsafe abode for a be your opinion ? " " at least i might go the length of say that there be some evidence that this may be so . " " exactly . but surely , if your supernatural theory be correct , it could work the young man evil in as easily as in . a devil with merely local power like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing . " " you put the matter more flippantly , , than you would probably do if you be bring into personal contact with these thing . your advice , then , as i understand it , be that the young man will be as safe in as in . he come in fifty minute . what would you recommend ? " " i recommend , sir , that you take a cab , call off your spaniel who be scratch at my front door , and proceed to to meet . " " and then ? " " and then you will say nothing to him at all until i have make up my mind about the matter . " " how long will it take you to make up your mind ? " " hour . at ten o'clock tomorrow , , i will be much oblige to you if you will call upon me here , and it will be of help to me in my plan for the future if you will bring with you . " " i will do so , . " he scribble the appointment on his and hurry off in his strange , peer , absent-minded fashion . stop him at the head of the stair . " only one more question , . you say that before 's death several people see this apparition upon the moor ? " " three people do . " " do any see it after ? " " i have not hear of any . " " thank you . . " return to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which mean that he have a congenial task before him . " go out , ? " " unless i can help you . " " no , my dear fellow , it be at the hour of action that i turn to you for aid . but this be splendid , really unique from some point of view . when you pass 's , would you ask him to send up a pound of the strong shag tobacco ? thank you . it would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening . then i should be very glad to compare impression as to this most interesting problem which have be submit to us this morning . " i know that seclusion and solitude be very necessary for my friend in those hour of intense mental concentration during which he weigh every particle of evidence , construct alternative theory , balance one against the other , and make up his mind as to which point be essential and which immaterial . i therefore spend the day at my club and do not return to until evening . it be nearly nine o'clock when i find myself in the sitting-room once more . my first impression as i open the door be that a fire have break out , for the room be so fill with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table be blur by it . as i enter , however , my fear be set at rest , for it be the acrid fume of strong coarse tobacco which take me by the throat and set me cough . through the haze i have a vague vision of in his dressing-gown coil up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lip . several roll of paper lie around him . " catch cold , ? " say he . " no , it be this poisonous atmosphere . " " i suppose it be pretty thick , now that you mention it . " " thick ! it be intolerable . " " open the window , then ! you have be at your club all day , i perceive . " " my dear ! " " be i right ? " " certainly , but how ? " he laugh at my bewilder expression . " there be a delightful freshness about you , , which make it a pleasure to exercise any small power which i possess at your expense . a gentleman go forth on a showery and miry day . he return immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boot . he have be a fixture therefore all day . he be not a man with intimate friend . where , then , could he have be ? be it not obvious ? " " well , it be rather obvious . " " the world be full of obvious thing which nobody by any chance ever observe . where do you think that i have be ? " " a fixture also . " " on the contrary , i have be to . " " in spirit ? " " exactly . my body have remain in this armchair and have , i regret to observe , consume in my absence two large pot of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco . after you leave i send down to 's for the map of this portion of the moor , and my spirit have hover over it all day . i flatter myself that i could find my way about . " " a large-scale map , i presume ? " " very large . " he unroll one section and hold it over his knee . " here you have the particular district which concern us . that be in the middle . " " with a wood round it ? " " exactly . i fancy the yew alley , though not mark under that name , must stretch along this line , with the moor , as you perceive , upon the right of it . this small clump of building here be the hamlet of , where our friend have his headquarters . within a radius of five mile there be , as you see , only a very few scattered dwelling . here be , which be mention in the narrative . there be a house indicate here which may be the residence of the , if i remember right , be his name . here be two moorland farmhouse , and . then fourteen mile away the great convict prison of . between and around these scattered point extend the desolate , lifeless moor . this , then , be the stage upon which tragedy have be play , and upon which we may help to play it again . " " it must be a wild place . " " yes , the setting be a worthy one . if the devil do desire to have a hand in the affair of -- " " then you be yourself incline to the supernatural explanation . " " the devil 's agent may be of flesh and blood , may they not ? there be two question wait for us at the outset . the one be whether any crime have be commit at all ; the second be , what be the crime and how be it commit ? of course , if 's surmise should be correct , and we be deal with force outside the ordinary law of nature , there be an end of our investigation . but we be bind to exhaust all other hypothesis before fall back upon this one . i think we will shut that window again , if you do n't mind . it be a singular thing , but i find that a concentrated atmosphere help a concentration of thought . i have not push it to the length of get into a box to think , but that be the logical outcome of my conviction . have you turn the case over in your mind ? " " yes , i have think a good deal of it in the course of the day . " " what do you make of it ? " " it be very bewilder . " " it have certainly a character of its own . there be point of distinction about it . that change in the footprint , for example . what do you make of that ? " " say that the man have walk on tiptoe down that portion of the alley . " " he only repeat what some fool have say at the inquest . why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley ? " " what then ? " " he be run , desperately , run for his life , run until he burst his fall dead upon his face . " " run from what ? " " there lie our problem . there be indication that the man be craze with fear before ever he begin to run . " " how can you say that ? " " i be presume that the cause of his fear come to him across the moor . if that be so , and it seem most probable , only a man who have lose his wit would have run from the house instead of towards it . if the gipsy 's evidence may be take as true , he run with cry for help in the direction where help be least likely to be . then , again , whom be he wait for that night , and why be he wait for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house ? " " you think that he be wait for someone ? " " the man be elderly and infirm . we can understand his take an evening stroll , but the ground be damp and the night inclement . be it natural that he should stand for five or ten minute , as , with more practical sense than i should have give him credit for , deduce from the cigar ash ? " " but he go out every evening . " " i think it unlikely that he wait at the every evening . on the contrary , the evidence be that he avoid the moor . that night he wait there . it be the night before he make his departure for . the thing take shape , . it become coherent . might i ask you to hand me my violin , and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have have the advantage of meeting and in the morning . " our breakfast table be clear early , and wait in his dressing-gown for the promised interview . our client be punctual to their appointment , for the clock have just strike ten when be show up , follow by the young baronet . the latter be a small , alert , dark-eyed man about thirty year of age , very sturdily build , with thick black eyebrow and a strong , pugnacious face . he wear a tweed suit and have the weather-beaten appearance of one who have spend most of his time in the open air , and yet there be something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicate the gentleman . " this be , " say . " why , yes , " say he , " and the strange thing be , , that if my friend here have not propose come round to you this morning i should have come on my own account . i understand that you think out little puzzle , and i have have one this morning which want more think out than i be able to give it . " " pray take a seat , . do i understand you to say that you have yourself have some remarkable experience since you arrive in ? " " nothing of much importance , . only a joke , as like as not . it be this letter , if you can call it a letter , which reach me this morning . " he lay an envelope upon the table , and we all bent over it . it be of common quality , grayish in colour . the address , " , , " be print in rough character ; the " , " and the date of post the preceding evening . " who know that you be go to the ? " ask , glance keenly across at our visitor . " no one could have know . we only decide after i meet . " " but be no doubt already stop there ? " " no , i have be stay with a friend , " say the doctor . " there be no possible indication that we intend to go to this hotel . " " hum ! someone seem to be very deeply interested in your movement . " out of the envelope he take a of foolscap paper fold into four . this he open and spread flat upon the table . across the middle of it a single sentence have be form by the expedient of paste print word upon it . it run : as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor . the word " moor " only be print in ink . " now , " say , " perhaps you will tell me , , what in thunder be the meaning of that , and who it be that take so much interest in my affair ? " " what do you make of it , ? you must allow that there be nothing supernatural about this , at any rate ? " " no , sir , but it might very well come from someone who be convince that the business be supernatural . " " what business ? " ask sharply . " it seem to me that all you gentleman know a great deal more than i do about my own affair . " " you shall share our knowledge before you leave this room , . i promise you that , " say . " we will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document , which must have be put together and post yesterday evening . have you yesterday 's , ? " " it be here in the corner . " " might i trouble you for inside page , please , with the lead article ? " he glance swiftly over it , run his eye up and down the column . " capital article this on free trade . permit me to give you an extract from it . ' you may be cajole into imagine that your own special trade or your own industry will be encourage by a protective tariff , but it stand to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country , diminish the value of our import , and lower the general condition of life in this island . ' " what do you think of that , ? " cry in high glee , rub his hand together with satisfaction . " do n't you think that be an admirable sentiment ? " look at with an air of professional interest , and turn a pair of puzzle dark eye upon me . " i do n't know much about the tariff and thing of that kind , " say he , " but it seem to me we have get a bit off the trail so far as that note be concern . " " on the contrary , i think we be particularly hot upon the trail , . here know more about my method than you do , but i fear that even he have not quite grasp the significance of this sentence . " " no , i confess that i see no connection . " " and yet , my dear , there be so very close a connection that the one be extract out of the other . ' you , ' ' your , ' ' your , ' ' life , ' ' reason , ' ' value , ' ' keep away , ' ' from the . ' do n't you see now whence these word have be take ? " " by thunder , you be right ! well , if that be n't smart ! " cry . " if any possible doubt remain it be settle by the fact that ' keep away ' and ' from the ' be cut out in one piece . " " well , it be ! " " really , , this exceed anything which i could have imagine , " say , gaze at my friend in amazement . " i could understand anyone say that the word be from a newspaper ; but that you should name which , and add that it come from the lead article , be really one of the most remarkable thing which i have ever know . how do you do it ? " " i presume , , that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an esquimau ? " " most certainly . " " but how ? " " because that be my special hobby . the difference be obvious . the crest , the facial angle , the curve , -- " " but this be my special hobby , and the difference be equally obvious . there be as much difference to my eye between the leaded bourgeois type of a article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your negro and your esquimau . the detection of type be one of the most elementary branch of knowledge to the special expert in crime , though i confess that once when i be very young i confuse the with the . but a leader be entirely distinctive , and these word could have be take from nothing else . as it be do yesterday the strong probability be that we should find the word in yesterday 's issue . " " so far as i can follow you , then , , " say , " someone cut out this message with a -- " " , " say . " you can see that it be a very scissors , since the cutter have to take two snip over ' keep away . ' " " that be so . someone , then , cut out the message with a pair of scissors , paste it with -- " " , " say . " with gum on to the paper . but i want to know why the word ' moor ' should have be write ? " " because he could not find it in print . the other word be all simple and might be find in any issue , but ' moor ' would be less common . " " why , of course , that would explain it . have you read anything else in this message , ? " " there be one or two indication , and yet the utmost pain have be take to remove all clue . the address , you observe be print in rough character . but the be a paper which be seldom find in any hand but those of the highly educate . we may take it , therefore , that the letter be compose by an educate man who wish to pose as an uneducated one , and his effort to conceal his own writing suggest that that writing might be know , or come to be know , by you . again , you will observe that the word be not gum on in an accurate line , but that some be much high than other . ' , ' for example be quite out of its proper place . that may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter . on the whole i incline to the latter view , since the matter be evidently important , and it be unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless . if he be in a hurry it open up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry , since any letter post up to early morning would reach before he would leave his hotel . do the composer fear an from whom ? " " we be come now rather into the region of guesswork , " say . " say , rather , into the region where we balance probability and choose the most likely . it be the scientific use of the imagination , but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation . now , you would call it a guess , no doubt , but i be almost certain that this address have be write in a hotel . " " how in the world can you say that ? " " if you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have give the writer trouble . the pen have splutter twice in a single word and have run dry three time in a short address , show that there be very little ink in the bottle . now , a private pen or ink-bottle be seldom allow to be in such a state , and the combination of the two must be quite rare . but you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen , where it be rare to get anything else . yes , i have very little hesitation in say that could we examine the basket of the hotel around until we find the remain of the mutilate leader we could lay our hand straight upon the person who send this singular message . halloa ! halloa ! what be this ? " he be carefully examine the foolscap , upon which the word be paste , hold it only an inch or two from his eye . " well ? " " nothing , " say he , throw it down . " it be a blank of paper , without even a upon it . i think we have draw as much as we can from this curious letter ; and now , , have anything else of interest happen to you since you have be in ? " " why , no , . i think not . " " you have not observe anyone follow or watch you ? " " i seem to have walk right into the thick of a dime novel , " say our visitor . " why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me ? " " we be come to that . you have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter ? " " well , it depend upon what you think worth reporting . " " i think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting . " smile . " i do n't know much of british life yet , for i have spend nearly all my time in the and in . but i hope that to lose one of your boot be not part of the ordinary routine of life over here . " " you have lose one of your boot ? " " my dear sir , " cry , " it be only mislay . you will find it when you return to the hotel . what be the use of troubling with trifle of this kind ? " " well , he ask me for anything outside the ordinary routine . " " exactly , " say , " however foolish the incident may seem . you have lose one of your boot , you say ? " " well , mislay it , anyhow . i put them both outside my door last night , and there be only one in the morning . i could get no sense out of the chap who clean them . the bad of it be that i only buy the pair last night in the , and i have never have them on . " " if you have never wear them , why do you put them out to be clean ? " " they be tan boot and have never be varnish . that be why i put them out . " " then i understand that on your arrival in yesterday you go out at once and buy a pair of boot ? " " i do a good deal of shopping . here go round with me . you see , if i be to be squire down there i must dress the part , and it may be that i have get a little careless in my way out . among other thing i buy these brown six dollar for have one steal before ever i have them on my foot . " " it seem a singularly useless thing to steal , " say . " i confess that i share 's belief that it will not be long before the missing boot be find . " " and , now , gentleman , " say the baronet with decision , " it seem to me that i have speak quite enough about the little that i know . it be time that you keep your promise and give me a full account of what we be all drive at . " " your request be a very reasonable one , " answer . " , i think you could not do well than to tell your story as you tell it to us . " thus encourage , our scientific friend draw his paper from his pocket and present the whole case as he have do upon the morning before . listen with the deep attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise . " well , i seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance , " say he when the long narrative be finish . " of course , i have hear of the hound ever since i be in the nursery . it be the pet story of the family , though i never think of take it seriously before . but as to my uncle 's , it all seem boil up in my head , and i ca n't get it clear yet . you do n't seem quite to have make up your mind whether it be a case for a policeman or a clergyman . " " precisely . " " and now there be this affair of the letter to me at the hotel . i suppose that fit into its place . " " it seem to show that someone know more than we do about what go on upon the moor , " say . " and also , " say , " that someone be not ill-disposed towards you , since they warn you of danger . " " or it may be that they wish , for their own purpose , to scare me away . " " well , of course , that be possible also . i be very much indebted to you , , for introduce me to a problem which present several interesting alternative . but the practical point which we now have to decide , , be whether it be or be not advisable for you to go to . " " why should i not go ? " " there seem to be danger . " " do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human being ? " " well , that be what we have to find out . " " whichever it be , my answer be fix . there be no devil in hell , , and there be no man upon earth who can prevent me from go to the home of my own people , and you may take that to be my final answer . " his dark brow knit and his face flush to a dusky red as he speak . it be evident that the fiery temper of the be not extinct in this their last representative . " meanwhile , " say he , " i have hardly have time to think over all that you have tell me . it be a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting . i should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind . now , look here , , it be eleven now and i be go back right away to my hotel . suppose you and your friend , , come round and lunch with us at two . i will be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strike me . " " be that convenient to you , ? " " perfectly . " " then you may expect us . shall i have a cab call ? " " i will prefer to walk , for this affair have flurry me rather . " " i will join you in a walk , with pleasure , " say his companion . " then we meet again at two o'clock . , and ! " we hear the step of our visitor descend the stair and the bang of the front door . in an instant have change from the languid dreamer to the man of action . " your hat and boot , , quick ! not a moment to lose ! " he rush into his room in his dressing-gown and be back again in a few second in a frock-coat . we hurry together down the stair and into the street . and be still visible about two hundred yard ahead of us in the direction of . " shall i run on and stop them ? " " not for the world , my dear . i be perfectly satisfy with your company if you will tolerate mine . our friend be wise , for it be certainly a very fine morning for a walk . " he quicken his pace until we have decrease the distance which divide us by about half . then , still keep a hundred yard behind , we follow into and so down . once our friend stop and stare into a shop window , upon which do the same . an instant afterwards he give a little cry of satisfaction , and , follow the direction of his eager eye , i see that a hansom cab with a man inside which have halt on the other side of the street be now proceed slowly onward again . " there be our man , ! come along ! we will have a good look at him , if we can do no more . " at that instant i be aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eye turn upon us through the side window of the cab . instantly the trapdoor at the top fly up , something be scream to the driver , and the cab fly madly off down . look eagerly round for another , but no empty one be in sight . then he dash in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic , but the start be too great , and already the cab be out of sight . " there now ! " say bitterly as he emerge pant and white with vexation from the tide of vehicle . " be ever such bad luck and such bad management , too ? , , if you be an honest man you will record this also and set it against my success ! " " who be the man ? " " i have not an idea . " " a spy ? " " well , it be evident from what we have hear that have be very closely shadow by someone since he have be in town . how else could it be know so quickly that it be the which he have choose ? if they have follow him the first day i argue that they would follow him also the second . you may have observe that i twice stroll over to the window while be read his legend . " " yes , i remember . " " i be look out for loiterer in the street , but i see none . we be deal with a clever man , . this matter cut very deep , and though i have not finally make up my mind whether it be a benevolent or a malevolent agency which be in touch with us , i be conscious always of power and design . when our friend leave i at once follow them in the hope of mark down their invisible attendant . so wily be he that he have not trust himself upon foot , but he have avail himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice . his method have the additional advantage that if they be to take a cab he be all ready to follow them . it have , however , one obvious disadvantage . " " it put him in the power of the cabman . " " exactly . " " what a pity we do not get the number ! " " my dear , clumsy as i have be , you surely do not seriously imagine that i neglect to get the number ? no. @card@ be our man . but that be no use to us for the moment . " " i fail to see how you could have do more . " " on observe the cab i should have instantly turn and walk in the other direction . i should then at my leisure have hire a second cab and follow the first at a respectful distance , or , well still , have drive to the and wait there . when our unknown have follow home we should have have the opportunity of play his own game upon himself and see where he make for . as it be , by an indiscreet eagerness , which be take advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent , we have betray ourselves and lose our man . " we have be saunter slowly down during this conversation , and , with his companion , have long vanish in front of us . " there be no object in our follow them , " say . " the shadow have depart and will not return . we must see what further card we have in our hand and play them with decision . could you swear to that man 's face within the cab ? " " i could swear only to the beard . " " and so could which i gather that in all probability it be a false one . a clever man upon so delicate an errand have no use for a beard save to conceal his feature . come in here , ! " he turn into one of the district messenger office , where he be warmly greet by the manager . " ah , , i see you have not forget the little case in which i have the good fortune to help you ? " " no , sir , indeed i have not . you save my good name , and perhaps my life . " " my dear fellow , you exaggerate . i have some recollection , , that you have among your boy a lad name , who show some ability during the investigation . " " yes , sir , he be still with us . " " could you ring him up ? -- you ! and i should be glad to have change of this five-pound note . " a lad of fourteen , with a bright , keen face , have obey the summons of the manager . he stand now gaze with great reverence at the famous detective . " let me have the , " say . " thank you ! now , , there be the name of hotel here , all in the immediate neighbourhood of . do you see ? " " yes , sir . " " you will visit each of these in turn . " " yes , sir . " " you will begin in each case by give the outside porter one shilling . here be shilling . " " yes , sir . " " you will tell him that you want to see the of yesterday . you will say that an important telegram have miscarry and that you be look for it . you understand ? " " yes , sir . " " but what you be really look for be the centre page of the with some hole cut in it with scissors . here be a copy of the . it be this page . you could easily recognize it , could you not ? " " yes , sir . " " in each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter , to whom also you will give a shilling . here be shilling . you will then learn in possibly twenty case out of the that the waste of the day before have be burn or remove . in the three other case you will be show a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the among it . the odd be enormously against your find it . there be ten shilling over in case of emergency . let me have a report by wire at before evening . and now , , it only remain for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman , no. @card@ , and then we will drop into one of the picture gallery and fill in the time until we be due at the hotel . " have , in a very remarkable degree , the power of detach his mind at will . for two hour the strange business in which we have be involve appear to be forget , and he be entirely absorb in the picture of the modern belgian master . he would talk of nothing but art , of which he have the crude idea , from our leave the gallery until we find ourselves at the . " be upstairs expect you , " say the clerk . " he ask me to show you up at once when you come . " " have you any objection to my look at your register ? " say . " not in the least . " the book show that two name have be add after that of . one be and family , of ; the other and maid , of , . " surely that must be the same whom i use to know , " say to the porter . " a lawyer , be he not , , and walk with a limp ? " " no , sir , this be , the , a very active gentleman , not old than yourself . " " surely you be mistake about his trade ? " " no , sir ! he have use this hotel for many year , and he be very well know to us . " " ah , that settle it . , too ; i seem to remember the name . excuse my curiosity , but often in call upon one friend one find another . " " she be an invalid lady , sir . her husband be once mayor of . she always come to us when she be in town . " " thank you ; i be afraid i can claim her acquaintance . we have establish a most important fact by these question , , " he continue in a low voice as we go upstairs together . " we know now that the people who be so interested in our friend have not settle down in his own hotel . that mean that while they be , as we have see , very anxious to watch him , they be equally anxious that he should not see them . now , this be a most suggestive fact . " " what do it suggest ? " " it , my dear fellow , what on earth be the matter ? " as we come round the top of the stair we have run up against himself . his face be flush with anger , and he hold an old and dusty boot in one of his hand . so furious be he that he be hardly articulate , and when he do speak it be in a much broad and more western dialect than any which we have hear from him in the morning . " seem to me they be play me for a sucker in this hotel , " he cry . " they will find they have start in to monkey with the wrong man unless they be careful . by thunder , if that chap ca n't find my missing boot there will be trouble . i can take a joke with the good , , but they have get a bit over the mark this time . " " still look for your boot ? " " yes , sir , and mean to find it . " " but , surely , you say that it be a new brown boot ? " " so it be , sir . and now it be an old black one . " " what ! you do n't mean to -- ? " " that be just what i do mean to say . i only have three pair in the new brown , the old black , and the patent leather , which i be wear . last night they take one of my brown one , and today they have sneak one of the black . well , have you get it ? speak out , man , and do n't stand stare ! " an agitate german waiter have appear upon the scene . " no , sir ; i have make inquiry all over the hotel , but i can hear no word of it . " " well , either that boot come back before sundown or i will see the manager and tell him that i go right straight out of this hotel . " " it shall be find , promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be find . " " mind it be , for it be the last thing of mine that i will lose in this den of thief . well , well , , you will excuse my trouble you about such a -- " " i think it be well worth trouble about . " " why , you look very serious over it . " " how do you explain it ? " " i just do n't attempt to explain it . it seem the very mad , queer thing that ever happen to me . " " the queer -- " say thoughtfully . " what do you make of it yourself ? " " well , i do n't profess to understand it yet . this case of yours be very complex , . when take in conjunction with your uncle 's death i be not sure that of all the five hundred case of capital importance which i have handle there be one which cut so deep . but we hold several thread in our hand , and the odd be that one or other of them guide us to the truth . we may waste time in follow the wrong one , but sooner or later we must come upon the right . " we have a pleasant luncheon in which little be say of the business which have bring us together . it be in the private sitting-room to which we afterwards repair that ask what be his intention . " to go to . " " and when ? " " at the end of the week . " " on the whole , " say , " i think that your decision be a wise one . i have ample evidence that you be be dog in , and amid the million of this great city it be difficult to discover who these people be or what their object can be . if their intention be evil they might do you a mischief , and we should be powerless to prevent it . you do not know , , that you be follow this morning from my house ? " start violently . " follow ! by whom ? " " that , unfortunately , be what i can tell you . have you among your neighbour or acquaintance on any man with a black , full beard ? " " , let me , yes . , 's butler , be a man with a full , black beard . " " ! where be ? " " he be in charge of the . " " we have well ascertain if he be really there , or if by any possibility he might be in . " " how can you do that ? " " give me a telegraph form . ' be all ready for ? ' that will do . address to , . what be the near ? . very good , we will send a second wire to the postmaster , : ' telegram to to be deliver into his own hand . if absent , please return wire to , . ' that should let us know before evening whether be at his post in or not . " " that be so , " say . " by the way , , who be this , anyhow ? " " he be the son of the old caretaker , who be dead . they have look after the for four generation now . so far as i know , he and his wife be as respectable a couple as any in the county . " " at the same time , " say , " it be clear enough that so long as there be none of the family at the these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do . " " that be true . " " do profit at all by 's will ? " ask . " he and his wife have five hundred pound each . " " ! do they know that they would receive this ? " " yes ; be very fond of talk about the provision of his will . " " that be very interesting . " " i hope , " say , " that you do not look with suspicious eye upon everyone who receive a legacy from , for i also have a thousand pound leave to me . " " indeed ! and anyone else ? " " there be many insignificant sum to individual , and a large number of public charity . the residue all go to . " " and how much be the residue ? " " seven hundred and forty thousand pound . " raise his eyebrow in surprise . " i have no idea that so gigantic a sum be involve , " say he . " have the reputation of be rich , but we do not know how very rich he be until we come to examine his security . the total value of the estate be close on to a million . " " me ! it be a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game . and one more question , . suppose that anything happen to our young friend will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis ! -- would inherit the estate ? " " since , 's young brother die unmarried , the estate would descend to the , who be distant cousin . be an elderly clergyman in . " " thank you . these detail be all of great interest . have you meet ? " " yes ; he once come down to visit . he be a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life . i remember that he refuse to accept any settlement from , though he press it upon him . " " and this man of simple taste would be the heir to 's thousand . " " he would be the heir to the estate because that be entail . he would also be the heir to the money unless it be will otherwise by the present owner , who can , of course , do what he like with it . " " and have you make your will , ? " " no , , i have not . i have have no time , for it be only yesterday that i learn how matter stand . but in any case i feel that the money should go with the title and estate . that be my poor uncle 's idea . how be the owner go to restore the glory of the if he have not money enough to keep up the property ? , land , and dollar must go together . " " quite so . well , , i be of one mind with you as to the advisability of your go down to without delay . there be only one provision which i must make . you certainly must not go alone . " " return with me . " " but have his practice to attend to , and his house be mile away from yours . with all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to help you . no , , you must take with you someone , a trusty man , who will be always by your side . " " be it possible that you could come yourself , ? " " if matter come to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in person ; but you can understand that , with my extensive consulting practice and with the constant appeal which reach me from many quarter , it be impossible for me to be absent from for an indefinite time . at the present instant one of the most revere name in be be besmirch by a blackmailer , and only i can stop a disastrous scandal . you will see how impossible it be for me to go to . " " whom would you recommend , then ? " lay his hand upon my arm . " if my friend would undertake it there be no man who be good worth have at your side when you be in a tight place . no one can say so more confidently than " the proposition take me completely by surprise , but before i have time to answer , seize me by the hand and wring it heartily . " well , now , that be real kind of you , , " say he . " you see how it be with me , and you know just as much about the matter as i do . if you will come down to and see me through i will never forget it . " the promise of adventure have always a fascination for me , and i be compliment by the word of and by the eagerness with which the baronet hail me as a companion . " i will come , with pleasure , " say " i do not know how i could employ my time well . " " and you will report very carefully to me , " say . " when a crisis come , as it will do , i will direct how you shall act . i suppose that by all might be ready ? " " would that suit ? " " perfectly . " " then on , unless you hear to the contrary , we shall meet at the train from . " we have rise to depart when give a cry , of triumph , and dive into one of the corner of the room he draw a brown boot from under a cabinet . " my missing boot ! " he cry . " all our difficulty vanish as easily ! " say . " but it be a very singular thing , " remark . " i search this room carefully before lunch . " " and so do i , " say . " every inch of it . " " there be certainly no boot in it then . " " in that case the waiter must have place it there while we be lunch . " the german be send for but profess to know nothing of the matter , nor could any inquiry clear it up . another item have be add to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mystery which have succeed each other so rapidly . set aside the whole grim story of 's death , we have a line of inexplicable incident all within the limit of two day , which include the receipt of the printed letter , the spy in the hansom , the loss of the new brown boot , the loss of the old black boot , and now the return of the new brown boot . sit in silence in the cab as we drive back to , and i know from his draw brow and keen face that his mind , like my own , be busy in endeavour to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnect episode could be fit . all afternoon and late into the evening he sit lose in tobacco and thought . just before dinner two telegram be hand in . the first run : have just hear that be at the . . the second : visit hotel as direct , but sorry , to report unable to trace cut sheet of . cartwright . " there go two of my thread , . there be nothing more stimulating than a case where everything go against you . we must cast round for another scent . " " we have still the cabman who drive the spy . " " exactly . i have wire to get his name and address from the official registry . i should not be surprise if this be an answer to my question . " the ring at the bell prove to be something even more satisfactory than an answer , however , for the door open and a fellow enter who be evidently the man himself . " i get a message from the head office that a gent at this address have be inquire for no. @card@ , " say he . " i have drive my cab this seven year and never a word of complaint . i come here straight from the to ask you to your face what you have against me . " " i have nothing in the world against you , my good man , " say . " on the contrary , i have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my question . " " well , i have have a good day and no mistake , " say the cabman with a grin . " what be it you want to ask , sir ? " " first of all your name and address , in case i want you again . " " , 3 , the . my cab be out of 's , near . " make a note of it . " now , , tell me all about the fare who come and watch this house at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards follow the two gentleman down . " the man look surprise and a little embarrassed . " why , there be no good my tell you thing , for you seem to know as much as i do already , " say he . " the truth be that the gentleman tell me that he be a detective and that i be to say nothing about him to anyone . " " my good fellow ; this be a very serious business , and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me . you say that your fare tell you that he be a detective ? " " yes , he do . " " when do he say this ? " " when he leave me . " " do he say anything more ? " " he mention his name . " cast a swift glance of triumph at me . " oh , he mention his name , do he ? that be imprudent . what be the name that he mention ? " " his name , " say the cabman , " be . " never have i see my friend more completely take aback than by the cabman 's reply . for an instant he sit in silent amazement . then he burst into a hearty laugh . " a touch , undeniable touch ! " say he . " i feel a foil as quick and supple as my own . he get home upon me very prettily that time . so his name be , be it ? " " yes , sir , that be the gentleman 's name . " " excellent ! tell me where you pick him up and all that occur . " " he hail me at nine in . he say that he be a detective , and he offer me two guinea if i would do exactly what he want all day and ask no question . i be glad enough to agree . first we drive down to the and wait there until two gentleman come out and take a cab from the rank . we follow their cab until it pull up somewhere near here . " " this very door , " say . " well , i could n't be sure of that , but i dare say my fare know all about it . we pull up halfway down the street and wait an hour and a half . then the two gentleman pass us , walk , and we follow down and -- " " i know , " say . " until we get three-quarter down . then my gentleman throw up the trap , and he cry that i should drive right away to as hard as i could go . i whip up the mare and we be there under the ten minute . then he pay up his two guinea , like a good one , and away he go into the station . only just as he be leave he turn round and he say : ' it might interest you to know that you have be drive . ' that be how i come to know the name . " " i see . and you see no more of him ? " " not after he go into the station . " " and how would you describe ? " the cabman scratch his head . " well , he be n't altogether such an easy gentleman to describe . i will put him at forty year of age , and he be of a middle height , two or three inch short than you , sir . he be dress like a toff , and he have a black beard , cut square at the end , and a pale face . i do n't know as i could say more than that . " " colour of his eye ? " " no , i ca n't say that . " " nothing more that you can remember ? " " no , sir ; nothing . " " well , then , here be your . there be another one waiting for you if you can bring any more information . ! " " , sir , and thank you ! " depart chuckle , and turn to me with a shrug of his shoulder and a rueful smile . " snap go our third thread , and we end where we begin , " say he . " the cunning rascal ! he know our number , know that have consult me , spot who i be in , conjecture that i have get the number of the cab and would lay my hand on the driver , and so send back this audacious message . i tell you , , this time we have get a foeman who be worthy of our steel . i have be checkmate in . i can only wish you good luck in . but i be not easy in my mind about it . " " about what ? " " about send you . it be an ugly business , , an ugly dangerous business , and the more i see of it the less i like it . yes , my dear fellow , you may laugh , but i give you my word that i shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in once more . " and be ready upon the appoint day , and we start as arrange for . drive with me to the station and give me his last parting injunction and advice . " i will not bias your mind by suggest theory or suspicion , , " say he ; " i wish you simply to report fact in the full possible manner to me , and you can leave me to do the theorize . " " what sort of fact ? " i ask . " anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the case , and especially the relation between young and his neighbour or any fresh particular concern the death of . i have make some inquiry myself in the last few day , but the result have , i fear , be negative . one thing only appear to be certain , and that be that , who be the next heir , be an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition , so that this persecution do not arise from him . i really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculation . there remain the people who will actually surround upon the moor . " " would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this couple ? " " by no mean . you could not make a great mistake . if they be innocent it would be a cruel injustice , and if they be guilty we should be give up all chance of bring it home to them . no , no , we will preserve them upon our list of suspect . then there be a groom at the , if i remember right . there be two moorland farmer . there be our friend , whom i believe to be entirely honest , and there be his wife , of whom we know nothing . there be this naturalist , , and there be his sister , who be say to be a young lady of attraction . there be , of , who be also an unknown factor , and there be one or two other neighbour . these be the folk who must be your very special study . " " i will do my good . " " you have arm , i suppose ? " " yes , i think it as well to take them . " " most certainly . keep your revolver near you night and day , and never relax your precaution . " our friend have already secure a first-class carriage and be wait for us upon the platform . " no , we have no news of any kind , " say in answer to my friend 's question . " i can swear to one thing , and that be that we have not be shadow during the last two day . we have never go out without keep a sharp watch , and no one could have escape our notice . " " you have always keep together , i presume ? " " except yesterday afternoon . i usually give up one day to pure amusement when i come to town , so i spend it at the of the of . " " and i go to look at the folk in the park , " say . " but we have no trouble of any kind . " " it be imprudent , all the same , " say , shake his head and look very grave . " i beg , , that you will not go about alone . some great misfortune will befall you if you do . do you get your other boot ? " " no , sir , it be go forever . " " indeed . that be very interesting . well , good-bye , " he add as the train begin to glide down the platform . " bear in mind , , one of the phrase in that queer old legend which have read to us , and avoid the moor in those hour of darkness when the power of evil be exalt . " i look back at the platform when we have leave it far behind and see the tall , austere figure of stand motionless and gaze after us . the journey be a swift and pleasant one , and i spend it in make the more intimate acquaintance of my two companion and in play with 's spaniel . in a very few hour the brown earth have become ruddy , the brick have change to granite , and red cow graze in field where the lush grass and more luxuriant vegetation speak of a rich , if a damper , climate . stare eagerly out of the window and cry aloud with delight as he recognize the familiar feature of the scenery . " i have be over a good part of the world since i leave it , , " say he ; " but i have never see a place to compare with it . " " i never see a man who do not swear by his county , " i remark . " it depend upon the breed of man quite as much as on the county , " say . " a glance at our friend here reveal the rounded head of the celt , which carry inside it the celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment . 's head be of a very rare type , half gaelic , half in its characteristic . but you be very young when you last see , be you not ? " " i be a boy in my teen at the time of my father 's death and have never see the , for he live in a little cottage on the . thence i go straight to a friend in . i tell you it be all as new to me as it be to , and i be as keen as possible to see the moor . " " be you ? then your wish be easily grant , for there be your first sight of the moor , " say , point out of the carriage window . over the green square of the field and the low curve of a wood there rise in the distance a gray , melancholy hill , with a strange jagged summit , dim and vague in the distance , like some fantastic landscape in a dream . sit for a long time , his eye fix upon it , and i read upon his eager face how much it mean to him , this first sight of that strange spot where the man of his blood have hold sway so long and leave their mark so deep . there he sit , with his tweed suit and his american accent , in the corner of a prosaic , and yet as i look at his dark and expressive face i feel more than ever how true a descendant he be of that long line of , fiery , and masterful man . there be pride , valour , and strength in his thick brow , his sensitive nostril , and his large hazel eye . if on that forbid moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us , this be at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it . the train pull up at a small wayside station and we all descend . outside , beyond the low , white fence , a wagonette with a pair of cob be wait . our come be evidently a great event , for station-master and porter cluster round us to carry out our luggage . it be a sweet , simple country spot , but i be surprise to observe that by the gate there stand two soldierly man in dark uniform who lean upon their short rifle and glance keenly at us as we pass . the coachman , a , gnarled little fellow , salute , and in a few minute we be fly swiftly down the broad , white road . roll pasture land curve upward on either side of us , and old gabled house peep out from amid the thick green foliage , but behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rise ever , dark against the evening sky , the long , gloomy curve of the moor , break by the jagged and sinister hill . the wagonette swing round into a side road , and we curve upward through deep lane wear by century of wheel , high bank on either side , heavy with drip moss and fleshy hart's-tongue fern . bronze bracken and mottle bramble gleam in the light of the sink sun . still steadily rise , we pass over a narrow granite bridge and skirt a noisy stream which gush swiftly down , foam and roar amid the gray boulder . both road and stream wind up through a valley dense with scrub oak and fir . at every turn give an exclamation of delight , look eagerly about him and ask countless question . to his eye all seem beautiful , but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside , which bear so clearly the mark of the wane year . yellow leave carpet the lane and flutter down upon us as we pass . the rattle of our wheel die away as we drive through drift of rot gift , as it seem to me , for to throw before the carriage of the return heir of the . " halloa ! " cry , " what be this ? " a steep curve of land , an outlying spur of the moor , lie in front of us . on the summit , hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its pedestal , be a mounted soldier , dark and stern , his rifle poise ready over his forearm . he be watch the road along which we travel . " what be this , ? " ask . our driver half turn in his seat . " there be a convict escape from , sir . he have be out three day now , and the warder watch every road and every station , but they have have no sight of him yet . the farmer about here do n't like it , sir , and that be a fact . " " well , i understand that they get five pound if they can give information . " " yes , sir , but the chance of five pound be but a poor thing compare to the chance of have your throat cut . you see , it be n't like any ordinary convict . this be a man that would stick at nothing . " " who be he , then ? " " it be , the murderer . " i remember the case well , for it be one in which have take an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton brutality which have mark all the action of the assassin . the commutation of his death sentence have be due to some doubt as to his complete sanity , so atrocious be his conduct . our wagonette have top a rise and in front of us rise the huge expanse of the moor , mottle with gnarled and craggy cairn and tor . a cold wind sweep down from it and set us shiver . somewhere there , on that desolate plain , be lurk this fiendish man , hide in a burrow like a wild beast , his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which have cast him out . it need but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste , the chilling wind , and the darkling sky . even fall silent and pull his overcoat more closely around him . we have leave the fertile country behind and beneath us . we look back on it now , the slanting ray of a low sun turn the stream to thread of gold and glow on the red earth new turn by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodland . the road in front of us grow bleak and wild over huge russet and olive slope , sprinkle with giant boulder . now and then we pass a moorland cottage , wall and roof with stone , with no creeper to break its harsh outline . suddenly we look down into a cuplike depression , patch with stunted oak and fir which have be twist and bend by the fury of year of storm . two high , narrow tower rise over the tree . the driver point with his whip . " , " say he . its master have rise and be stare with flush cheek and shine eye . a few minute later we have reach the , a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron , with pillar on either side , blotch with lichen , and surmount by the boar ' head of the . the lodge be a ruin of black granite and bare rib of rafter , but face it be a new building , half construct , the first fruit of 's south african gold . through the gateway we pass into the avenue , where the wheel be again hush amid the leave , and the old tree shoot their branch in a sombre tunnel over our head . shudder as he look up the long , dark drive to where the house glimmer like a ghost at the farther end . " be it here ? " he ask in a low voice . " no , no , the yew alley be on the other side . " the young heir glance round with a gloomy face . " it be no wonder my uncle feel as if trouble be come on him in such a place as this , " say he . " it be enough to scare any man . i will have a row of electric lamp up here inside of six month , and you wo n't know it again , with a thousand candle-power and right here in front of the hall door . " the avenue open into a broad expanse of turf , and the house lie before us . in the fading light i could see that the centre be a heavy block of building from which a porch project . the whole front be drape in ivy , with a patch clip bare here and there where a window or a coat of arm break through the dark veil . from this central block rise the twin tower , ancient , crenelate , and pierce with many loophole . to right and leave of the turret be more modern wing of black granite . a dull light shine through heavy mullioned window , and from the high chimney which rise from the steep , roof there spring a single black column of smoke . " welcome , ! welcome to ! " a tall man have step from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonette . the figure of a woman be silhouette against the yellow light of the hall . she come out and help the man to hand down our bag . " you do n't mind my driving straight home , ? " say . " my wife be expect me . " " surely you will stay and have some dinner ? " " no , i must go . i shall probably find some work await me . i would stay to show you over the house , but will be a good guide than good-bye , and never hesitate night or day to send for me if i can be of service . " the wheel die away down the drive while and i turn into the hall , and the door clang heavily behind us . it be a fine apartment in which we find ourselves , large , lofty , and heavily raftered with huge baulk of oak . in the great old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dog a crackle and snap . and i hold out our hand to it , for we be numb from our long drive . then we gaze round us at the high , thin window of old stain glass , the oak panelling , the stag ' head , the coat of arm upon the wall , all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp . " it be just as i imagine it , " say . " be it not the very picture of an old family home ? to think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred year my people have live . it strike me solemn to think of it . " i see his dark face light up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gaze about him . the light beat upon him where he stand , but long shadow trail down the wall and hang like a black canopy above him . have return from take our luggage to our room . he stand in front of us now with the subdued manner of a well-trained servant . he be a man , tall , handsome , with a square black beard and pale , distinguished feature . " would you wish dinner to be serve at once , sir ? " " be it ready ? " " in a very few minute , sir . you will find hot water in your room . my wife and i will be happy , , to stay with you until you have make your fresh arrangement , but you will understand that under the new condition this house will require a considerable staff . " " what new condition ? " " i only mean , sir , that lead a very retire life , and we be able to look after his want . you would , naturally , wish to have more company , and so you will need change in your household . " " do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave ? " " only when it be quite convenient to you , sir . " " but your family have be with us for several generation , have they not ? i should be sorry to begin my life here by break an old family connection . " i seem to discern some sign of emotion upon the butler 's white face . " i feel that also , sir , and so do my wife . but to tell the truth , sir , we be both very much attach to , and his death give us a shock and make these surroundings very painful to us . i fear that we shall never again be easy in our mind at . " " but what do you intend to do ? " " i have no doubt , sir , that we shall succeed in establish ourselves in some business . 's generosity have give us the mean to do so . and now , sir , perhaps i have well show you to your room . " a square gallery run round the top of the old hall , approach by a double stair . from this central point two long corridor extend the whole length of the building , from which all the bedroom open . my own be in the same wing as 's and almost next door to it . these room appear to be much more modern than the central part of the house , and the bright paper and numerous candle do something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival have leave upon my mind . but the dining-room which open out of the hall be a place of shadow and gloom . it be a long chamber with a step separate the dais where the family sit from the low portion reserve for their dependent . at one end a minstrel 's gallery overlook it . black beam shoot across above our head , with a ceiling beyond them . with row of flare torch to light it up , and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet , it might have soften ; but now , when two gentleman sit in the little circle of light throw by a shaded lamp , one 's voice become hush and one be spirit subdue . a dim line of ancestor , in every variety of dress , from the elizabethan knight to the buck of the regency , stare down upon us and daunt us by their silent company . we talk little , and i for one be glad when the meal be over and we be able to retire into the modern billiard-room and smoke a cigarette . " my word , it be n't a very cheerful place , " say . " i suppose one can tone down to it , but i feel a bit out of the picture at present . i do n't wonder that my uncle get a little jumpy if he live all alone in such a house as this . however , if it suit you , we will retire early tonight , and perhaps thing may seem more cheerful in the morning . " i draw aside my curtain before i go to bed and look out from my window . it open upon the grassy space which lie in front of the hall door . beyond , two copse of tree moan and swing in a rise wind . a half moon break through the rift of race cloud . in its cold light i see beyond the tree a break fringe of rock , and the long , low curve of the melancholy moor . i close the curtain , feel that my last impression be in keep with the rest . and yet it be not quite the last . i find myself weary and yet wakeful , toss restlessly from side to side , seek for the sleep which would not come . far away a chime clock strike out the quarter of the hour , but otherwise a deathly silence lie upon the old house . and then suddenly , in the very dead of the night , there come a sound to my ear , clear , resonant , and unmistakable . it be the sob of a woman , the muffle , strangle gasp of one who be tear by an uncontrollable sorrow . i sit up in bed and listen intently . the noise could not have be far away and be certainly in the house . for half an hour i wait with every nerve on the alert , but there come no other sound save the chime clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall . the fresh beauty of the follow morning do something to efface from our mind the grim and gray impression which have be leave upon both of us by our first experience of . as and i sit at breakfast the sunlight flood in through the high mullioned window , throw watery patch of colour from the coat of arm which cover them . the dark panelling glow like bronze in the golden ray , and it be hard to realize that this be indeed the chamber which have strike such a gloom into our soul upon the evening before . " i guess it be ourselves and not the house that we have to blame ! " say the baronet . " we be tire with our journey and chill by our drive , so we take a gray view of the place . now we be fresh and well , so it be all cheerful once more . " " and yet it be not entirely a question of imagination , " i answer . " do you , for example , happen to hear someone , a woman i think , sob in the night ? " " that be curious , for i do when i be half asleep fancy that i hear something of the sort . i wait quite a time , but there be no more of it , so i conclude that it be all a dream . " " i hear it distinctly , and i be sure that it be really the sob of a woman . " " we must ask about this right away . " he ring the bell and ask whether he could account for our experience . it seem to me that the pallid feature of the butler turn a shade pale still as he listen to his master 's question . " there be only two woman in the house , , " he answer . " one be the , who sleep in the other wing . the other be my wife , and i can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her . " and yet he lie as he say it , for it chance that after breakfast i meet in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face . she be a large , impassive , woman with a stern set expression of mouth . but her telltale eye be red and glance at me from between swollen lid . it be she , then , who weep in the night , and if she do so her husband must know it . yet he have take the obvious risk of discovery in declare that it be not so . why have he do this ? and why do she weep so bitterly ? already round this , handsome , man there be gather an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom . it be he who have be the first to discover the body of , and we have only his word for all the circumstance which lead up to the old man 's death . be it possible that it be , after all , whom we have see in the cab in ? the beard might well have be the same . the cabman have describe a somewhat short man , but such an impression might easily have be erroneous . how could i settle the point forever ? obviously the first thing to do be to see the postmaster and find whether the test telegram have really be place in 's own hand . be the answer what it might , i should at least have something to report to . have numerous paper to examine after breakfast , so that the time be propitious for my excursion . it be a pleasant walk of four mile along the edge of the moor , lead me at last to a small gray hamlet , in which two large building , which prove to be the inn and the house of , stand high above the rest . the postmaster , who be also the village grocer , have a clear recollection of the telegram . " certainly , sir , " say he , " i have the telegram deliver to exactly as direct . " " who deliver it ? " " my boy here . , you deliver that telegram to at the last week , do you not ? " " yes , father , i deliver it . " " into his own hand ? " i ask . " well , he be up in the loft at the time , so that i could not put it into his own hand , but i give it into 's hand , and she promise to deliver it at once . " " do you see ? " " no , sir ; i tell you he be in the loft . " " if you do n't see him , how do you know he be in the loft ? " " well , surely his own wife ought to know where he be , " say the postmaster testily . " do n't he get the telegram ? if there be any mistake it be for himself to complain . " it seem hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther , but it be clear that in spite of 's ruse we have no proof that have not be in london all the time . suppose that it be that the same man have be the last who have see alive , and the first to dog the new heir when he return to . what then ? be he the agent of other or have he some sinister design of his own ? what interest could he have in persecute the family ? i think of the strange warning clip out of the lead article of the . be that his work or be it possibly the do of someone who be bend upon counteract his scheme ? the only conceivable motive be that which have be suggest by , that if the family could be scare away a comfortable and permanent home would be secure for the . but surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep and subtle scheme which seem to be weave an invisible net round the young baronet . himself have say that no more complex case have come to him in all the long series of his sensational investigation . i pray , as i walk back along the gray , lonely road , that my friend might soon be free from his preoccupation and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulder . suddenly my thought be interrupt by the sound of run foot behind me and by a voice which call me by name . i turn , expect to see , but to my surprise it be a stranger who be pursue me . he be a small , slim , clean-shaven , man , flaxen-haired and , between thirty and forty year of age , dress in a gray suit and wear a straw hat . a tin box for botanical specimen hang over his shoulder and he carry a green in one of his hand . " you will , i be sure , excuse my presumption , , " say he as he come pant up to where i stand . " here on the moor we be homely folk and do not wait for formal introduction . you may possibly have hear my name from our mutual friend , . i be , of . " " your net and box would have tell me as much , " say i , " for i know that be a naturalist . but how do you know me ? " " i have be call on , and he point you out to me from the window of his surgery as you pass . as our road lie the same way i think that i would overtake you and introduce myself . i trust that be none the bad for his journey ? " " he be very well , thank you . " " we be all rather afraid that after the sad death of the new baronet might refuse to live here . it be ask much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind , but i need not tell you that it mean a very great deal to the countryside . have , i suppose , no superstitious fear in the matter ? " " i do not think that it be likely . " " of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunt the family ? " " i have hear it . " " it be extraordinary how credulous the peasant be about here ! any number of them be ready to swear that they have see such a creature upon the moor . " he speak with a smile , but i seem to read in his eye that he take the matter more seriously . " the story take a great hold upon the imagination of , and i have no doubt that it lead to his tragic end . " " but how ? " " his nerve be so work up that the appearance of any dog might have have a fatal effect upon his diseased heart . i fancy that he really do see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley . i fear that some disaster might occur , for i be very fond of the old man , and i know that his heart be weak . " " how do you know that ? " " my friend tell me . " " you think , then , that some dog pursue , and that he die of fright in consequence ? " " have you any good explanation ? " " i have not come to any conclusion . " " have ? " the word take away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid face and steadfast eye of my companion show that no surprise be intend . " it be useless for us to pretend that we do not know you , , " say he . " the record of your detective have reach us here , and you could not celebrate him without be know yourself . when tell me your name he could not deny your identity . if you be here , then it follow that be interest himself in the matter , and i be naturally curious to know what view he may take . " " i be afraid that i can answer that question . " " may i ask if he be go to honour us with a visit himself ? " " he can leave town at present . he have other case which engage his attention . " " what a pity ! he might throw some light on that which be so dark to us . but as to your own research , if there be any possible way in which i can be of service to you i trust that you will command me . if i have any indication of the nature of your suspicion or how you propose to investigate the case , i might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice . " " i assure you that i be simply here upon a visit to my friend , , and that i need no help of any kind . " " excellent ! " say . " you be perfectly right to be wary and discreet . i be justly reprove for what i feel be an unjustifiable intrusion , and i promise you that i will not mention the matter again . " we have come to a point where a narrow grassy path strike off from the road and wind away across the moor . a steep , hill lie upon the right which have in bygone day be cut into a granite quarry . the face which be turn towards us form a dark cliff , with fern and bramble grow in its niche . from over a distant rise there float a gray plume of smoke . " a moderate walk along this bring us to , " say he . " perhaps you will spare an hour that i may have the pleasure of introduce you to my sister . " my first thought be that i should be by 's side . but then i remember the pile of paper and bill with which his study table be litter . it be certain that i could not help with those . and have expressly say that i should study the neighbour upon the moor . i accept 's invitation , and we turn together down the path . " it be a wonderful place , the moor , " say he , look round over the undulate down , long green roller , with crest of jagged granite foam up into fantastic surge . " you never tire of the moor . you can think the wonderful secret which it contain . it be so vast , and so barren , and so mysterious . " " you know it well , then ? " " i have only be here two year . the resident would call me a newcomer . we come shortly after settle . but my taste lead me to explore every part of the country round , and i should think that there be few man who know it good than i do . " " be it hard to know ? " " very hard . you see , for example , this great plain to the north here with the queer hill break out of it . do you observe anything remarkable about that ? " " it would be a rare place for a gallop . " " you would naturally think so and the thought have cost several their life before now . you notice those bright green spot scatter thickly over it ? " " yes , they seem more fertile than the rest . " laugh . " that be the great , " say he . " a false step yonder mean death to man or beast . only yesterday i see one of the moor pony wander into it . he never come out . i see his head for quite a long time crane out of the , but it suck him down at last . even in dry season it be a danger to cross it , but after these autumn rain it be an awful place . and yet i can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive . by , there be another of those miserable pony ! " something brown be roll and toss among the green sedge . then a long , agonize , writhe neck shoot upward and a dreadful cry echo over the moor . it turn me cold with horror , but my companion 's nerve seem to be strong than mine . " it be go ! " say he . " the mire have him . two in two day , and many more , perhaps , for they get in the way of go there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire have them in its clutch . it be a bad place , the great . " " and you say you can penetrate it ? " " yes , there be one or two path which a very active man can take . i have find them out . " " but why should you wish to go into so horrible a place ? " " well , you see the hill beyond ? they be really island cut off on all side by the impassable mire , which have crawl round them in the course of year . that be where the rare plant and the butterfly be , if you have the wit to reach them . " " i shall try my luck some day . " he look at me with a surprised face . " for 's sake put such an idea out of your mind , " say he . " your blood would be upon my head . i assure you that there would not be the least chance of your come back alive . it be only by remember certain complex landmark that i be able to do it . " " halloa ! " i cry . " what be that ? " a long , low moan , indescribably sad , sweep over the moor . it fill the whole air , and yet it be impossible to say whence it come . from a dull murmur it swell into a deep roar , and then sink back into a melancholy , throb murmur once again . look at me with a curious expression in his face . " queer place , the moor ! " say he . " but what be it ? " " the peasant say it be the hound of the calling for its prey . i have hear it once or twice before , but never quite so loud . " i look round , with a chill of fear in my heart , at the huge swell plain , mottle with the green patch of rush . nothing stir over the vast expanse save a pair of raven , which croak loudly from a tor behind us . " you be an educate man . you do n't believe such nonsense as that ? " say " what do you think be the cause of so strange a sound ? " " bog make queer noise sometimes . it be the mud settling , or the water rise , or something . " " no , no , that be a live voice . " " well , perhaps it be . do you ever hear a bittern booming ? " " no , i never do . " " it be a very rare now , but all thing be possible upon the moor . yes , i should not be surprise to learn that what we have hear be the cry of the last of the bittern . " " it be the weird , strange thing that ever i hear in my life . " " yes , it be rather an uncanny place altogether . look at the hillside yonder . what do you make of those ? " the whole steep slope be cover with gray circular ring of stone , a score of them at least . " what be they ? ? " " no , they be the home of our worthy ancestor . prehistoric man live thickly on the moor , and as no one in particular have live there since , we find all his little arrangement exactly as he leave them . these be his wigwam with the roof off . you can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside . " but it be quite a town . when be it inhabit ? " " neolithic date . " " what do he do ? " " he graze his cattle on these slope , and he learn to dig for tin when the bronze sword begin to supersede the stone axe . look at the great trench in the opposite hill . that be his mark . yes , you will find some very singular point about the moor , . oh , excuse me an instant ! it be surely . " a small fly or moth have flutter across our path , and in an instant be rush with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature fly straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never pause for an instant , bound from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net wave in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress make him not unlike some huge moth himself . i be stand watch his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i hear the sound of step and , turn round , find a woman near me upon the path . she have come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicate the position of , but the dip of the moor have hide her until she be quite close . i could not doubt that this be the of whom i have be tell , since lady of any sort must be few upon the moor , and i remember that i have hear someone describe her as be a beauty . the woman who approach me be certainly that , and of a most uncommon type . there could not have be a great contrast between brother and sister , for be neutral tint , with light hair and gray eye , while she be dark than any brunette whom i have see in , elegant , and tall . she have a proud , finely cut face , so regular that it might have seem impassive be it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark , eager eye . with her perfect figure and elegant dress she be , indeed , a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path . her eye be on her brother as i turn , and then she quicken her pace towards me . i have raise my hat and be about to make some explanatory remark when her own word turn all my thought into a new channel . " go back ! " she say . " go straight back to , instantly . " i could only stare at her in stupid surprise . her eye blaze at me , and she tap the ground impatiently with her foot . " why should i go back ? " i ask . " i can explain . " she speak in a low , eager voice , with a curious lisp in her utterance . " but for 's sake do what i ask you . go back and never set foot upon the moor again . " " but i have only just come . " " man , man ! " she cry . " can you not tell when a warning be for your own good ? go back to ! start tonight ! get away from this place at all cost ! , my brother be come ! not a word of what i have say . would you mind get that orchid for me among the mare's-tail yonder ? we be very rich in orchid on the moor , though , of course , you be rather late to see the beauty of the place . " have abandon the chase and come back to us breathe hard and flush with his exertion . " halloa , ! " say he , and it seem to me that the tone of his greeting be not altogether a cordial one . " well , , you be very hot . " " yes , i be chase a . he be very rare and seldom find in the late autumn . what a pity that i should have miss him ! " he speak unconcernedly , but his small light eye glance incessantly from the girl to me . " you have introduce , i can see . " " yes . i be tell that it be rather late for him to see the true beauty of the moor . " " why , who do you think this be ? " " i imagine that it must be . " " no , no , " say " only a humble commoner , but his friend . my name be . " a flush of vexation pass over her expressive face . " we have be talk at cross purpose , " say she . " why , you have not very much time for talk , " her brother remark with the same questioning eye . " i talk as if be a resident instead of be merely a visitor , " say she . " it can much matter to him whether it be early or late for the orchid . but you will come on , will you not , and see ? " a short walk bring us to it , a bleak moorland house , once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous day , but now put into repair and turn into a modern dwelling . an orchard surround it , but the tree , as be usual upon the moor , be stunt and nip , and the effect of the whole place be mean and melancholy . we be admit by a strange , wizened , old manservant , who seem in keep with the house . inside , however , there be large room furnish with an elegance in which i seem to recognize the taste of the lady . as i look from their window at the interminable moor roll unbroken to the farthest horizon i could not but marvel at what could have bring this highly educate man and this beautiful woman to live in such a place . " queer spot to choose , be it not ? " say he as if in answer to my thought . " and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy , do we not , ? " " quite happy , " say she , but there be no ring of conviction in her word . " i have a school , " say . " it be in the north country . the work to a man of my temperament be mechanical and uninteresting , but the privilege of live with youth , of help to mould those young mind , and of impress them with one 's own character and ideal be very dear to me . however , the fate be against us . a serious epidemic break out in the school and three of the boy die . it never recover from the blow , and much of my capital be irretrievably swallow up . and yet , if it be not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boy , i could rejoice over my own misfortune , for , with my strong taste for botany and zoology , i find an unlimited field of work here , and my sister be as devote to as i be . all this , , have be bring upon your head by your expression as you survey the moor out of our window . " " it certainly do cross my mind that it might be a little for you , perhaps , than for your sister . " " no , no , i be never dull , " say she quickly . " we have book , we have our study , and we have interesting neighbour . be a most learned man in his own line . be also an admirable companion . we know him well and miss him more than i can tell . do you think that i should intrude if i be to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of ? " " i be sure that he would be delight . " " then perhaps you would mention that i propose to do so . we may in our humble way do something to make thing more easy for him until he become accustom to his new surroundings . will you come upstairs , , and inspect my collection of ? i think it be the most complete one in the of . by the time that you have look through them lunch will be almost ready . " but i be eager to get back to my charge . the melancholy of the moor , the death of the unfortunate pony , the weird sound which have be associate with the grim legend of the , all these thing ting my thought with sadness . then on the top of these more or less vague impression there have come the definite and distinct warning of , deliver with such intense earnestness that i could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lie behind it . i resist all pressure to stay for lunch , and i set off at once upon my return journey , take the path by which we have come . it seem , however , that there must have be some short cut for those who know it , for before i have reach the road i be astound to see sit upon a rock by the side of the track . her face be beautifully flush with her exertion and she hold her hand to her side . " i have run all the way in order to cut you off , , " say she . " i have not even time to put on my hat . i must not stop , or my brother may miss me . i want to say to you how sorry i be about the stupid mistake i make in think that you be . please forget the word i say , which have no application whatever to you . " " but i ca n't forget them , , " say " i be 's friend , and his welfare be a very close concern of mine . tell me why it be that you be so eager that should return to . " " a woman 's whim , . when you know me better you will understand that i can always give reason for what i say or do . " " no , no . i remember the thrill in your voice . i remember the look in your eye . please , please , be frank with me , , for ever since i have be here i have be conscious of shadow all round me . have become like that great , with little green patch everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track . tell me then what it be that you mean , and i will promise to convey your warning to . " an expression of irresolution pass for an instant over her face , but her eye have harden again when she answer me . " you make too much of it , , " say she . " my brother and i be very much shock by the death of . we know him very intimately , for his favourite walk be over the moor to our house . he be deeply impress with the curse which hang over the family , and when this tragedy come i naturally feel that there must be some ground for the fear which he have express . i be distressed therefore when another member of the family come down to live here , and i feel that he should be warn of the danger which he will run . that be all which i intend to convey . " but what be the danger ? " " you know the story of the hound ? " " i do not believe in such nonsense . " " but i do . if you have any influence with , take him away from a place which have always be fatal to his family . the world be wide . why should he wish to live at the place of danger ? " " because it be the place of danger . that be 's nature . i fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move . " " i can say anything definite , for i do not know anything definite . " " i would ask you one more question , . if you mean no more than this when you first speak to me , why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you say ? there be nothing to which he , or anyone else , could object . " " my brother be very anxious to have the inhabit , for he think it be for the good of the poor folk upon the moor . he would be very angry if he know that i have say anything which might induce to go away . but i have do my duty now and i will say no more . i must go back , or he will miss me and suspect that i have see you . good-bye ! " she turn and have disappear in a few minute among the scattered boulder , while i , with my soul full of vague fear , pursue my way to . from this point onward i will follow the course of event by transcribe my own letter to which lie before me on the table . one page be miss , but otherwise they be exactly as write and show my feeling and suspicion of the moment more accurately than my memory , clear as it be upon these tragic event , can possibly do . , 13th . my : my previous letter and telegram have keep you pretty well up to date as to all that have occur in this most god-forsaken corner of the world . the longer one stay here the more do the spirit of the moor sink into one 's soul , its vastness , and also its grim charm . when you be once out upon its bosom you have leave all trace of modern behind you , but , on the other hand , you be conscious everywhere of the home and the work of the prehistoric people . on all side of you as you walk be the house of these forgotten folk , with their grave and the huge monolith which be suppose to have mark their temple . as you look at their gray stone hut against the scar hillside you leave your own age behind you , and if you be to see a , hairy man crawl out from the low door fit a arrow on to the string of his bow , you would feel that his presence there be more natural than your own . the strange thing be that they should have live so thickly on what must always have be most unfruitful soil . i be no antiquarian , but i could imagine that they be some and harry race who be force to accept that which none other would occupy . all this , however , be foreign to the mission on which you send me and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind . i can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun move round the earth or the earth round the sun . let me , therefore , return to the fact concern . if you have not have any report within the last few day it be because up to today there be nothing of importance to relate . then a very surprising circumstance occur , which i shall tell you in due course . but , first of all , i must keep you in touch with some of the other factor in the situation . one of these , concerning which i have say little , be the escape convict upon the moor . there be strong reason now to believe that he have get right away , which be a considerable relief to the lonely householder of this district . a fortnight have pass since his flight , during which he have not be see and nothing have be hear of him . it be surely inconceivable that he could have hold out upon the moor during all that time . of course , so far as his concealment go there be no difficulty at all . any one of these stone hut would give him a hiding-place . but there be nothing to eat unless he be to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep . we think , therefore , that he have go , and the outlying farmer sleep the good in consequence . we be four able-bodied man in this household , so that we could take good care of ourselves , but i confess that i have have uneasy moment when i have think of the . they live mile from any help . there be one maid , an old manservant , the sister , and the brother , the latter not a very strong man . they would be helpless in the hand of a desperate fellow like this criminal if he could once effect an entrance . both and i be concern at their situation , and it be suggest that the groom should go over to sleep there , but would not hear of it . the fact be that our friend , the baronet , begin to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour . it be not to be wonder at , for time hang heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him , and she be a very fascinating and beautiful woman . there be something tropical and exotic about her which form a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother . yet he also give the idea of hidden fire . he have certainly a very mark influence over her , for i have see her continually glance at him as she talk as if seek approbation for what she say . i trust that he be kind to her . there be a dry glitter in his eye and a firm set of his thin lip , which go with a positive and possibly a harsh nature . you would find him an interesting study . he come over to call upon on that first day , and the very next morning he take us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked be suppose to have have its origin . it be an excursion of some mile across the moor to a place which be so dismal that it might have suggest the story . we find a short valley between rugged tor which lead to an open , grassy space fleck over with the white cotton grass . in the middle of it rise two great stone , wear and sharpen at the upper end until they look like the huge corrode fang of some monstrous beast . in every way it correspond with the scene of the old tragedy . be much interested and ask more than once whether he do really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affair of man . he speak lightly , but it be evident that he be very much in earnest . be guard in his reply , but it be easy to see that he say less than he might , and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feeling of the baronet . he tell us of similar case , where family have suffer from some evil influence , and he leave us with the impression that he share the popular view upon the matter . on our way back we stay for lunch at , and it be there that make the acquaintance of . from the first moment that he see her he appear to be strongly attract by her , and i be much mistake if the feeling be not mutual . he refer to her again and again on our walk home , and since then hardly a day have pass that we have not see something of the brother and sister . they dine here tonight , and there be some talk of our go to them next week . one would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to , and yet i have more than once catch a look of the strong disapprobation in his face when have be pay some attention to his sister . he be much attach to her , no doubt , and would lead a lonely life without her , but it would seem the height of selfishness if he be to stand in the way of her make so brilliant a marriage . yet i be certain that he do not wish their intimacy to ripen into love , and i have several time observe that he have take pain to prevent them from be tete-a-tete . by the way , your instruction to me never to allow to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love affair be to be add to our other difficulty . my popularity would soon suffer if i be to carry out your order to the letter . the other , to be more . lunch with us . he have be excavate a barrow at and have get a prehistoric skull which fill him with great joy . never be there such a single-minded enthusiast as he ! the come in afterwards , and the good doctor take us all to the yew alley at 's request to show us exactly how everything occur upon that fatal night . it be a long , dismal walk , the yew alley , between two high wall of clip hedge , with a narrow band of grass upon either side . at the far end be an old tumble-down summer-house . halfway down be the , where the old gentleman leave his . it be a white wooden gate with a latch . beyond it lie the wide moor . i remember your theory of the affair and try to picture all that have occur . as the old man stand there he see something come across the moor , something which terrify him so that he lose his wit and run and run until he die of sheer horror and exhaustion . there be the long , gloomy tunnel down which he flee . and from what ? a of the moor ? or a spectral hound , black , silent , and monstrous ? be there a human agency in the matter ? do the pale , watchful know more than he care to say ? it be all dim and vague , but always there be the dark shadow of crime behind it . one other neighbour i have meet since i write last . this be , of , who live some four mile to the south of us . he be an elderly man , red-faced , white-haired , and choleric . his passion be for the british law , and he have spend a large fortune in litigation . he fight for the mere pleasure of fighting and be equally ready to take up either side of a question , so that it be no wonder that he have find it a costly amusement . sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make him open it . at other he will with his own hand tear down some other man 's gate and declare that a path have exist there from time immemorial , defy the owner to prosecute him for trespass . he be learn in old manorial and communal right , and he apply his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villager of and sometimes against them , so that he be periodically either carry in triumph down the village street or else burn in effigy , accord to his late exploit . he be say to have about seven lawsuit upon his hand at present , which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future . apart from the law he seem a kindly , good-natured person , and i only mention him because you be particular that i should send some description of the people who surround us . he be curiously employ at present , for , be an amateur astronomer , he have an excellent telescope , with which he lie upon the roof of his own house and sweep the moor all day in the hope of catch a glimpse of the escape convict . if he would confine his energy to this all would be well , but there be rumour that he intend to prosecute for open a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dig up the neolithic skull in the barrow on . he help to keep our life from be monotonous and give a little comic relief where it be badly need . and now , have bring you up to date in the escape convict , the , , and , of , let me end on that which be most important and tell you more about the , and especially about the surprising development of last night . first of all about the test telegram , which you send from in order to make sure that be really here . i have already explain that the testimony of the postmaster show that the test be worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other . i tell how the matter stand , and he at once , in his downright fashion , have up and ask him whether he have receive the telegram himself . say that he have . " do the boy deliver it into your own hand ? " ask . look surprise , and consider for a little time . " no , " say he , " i be in the at the time , and my wife bring it up to me . " " do you answer it yourself ? " " no ; i tell my wife what to answer and she go down to write it . " in the evening he recur to the subject of his own accord . " i could not quite understand the object of your question this morning , , " say he . " i trust that they do not mean that i have do anything to forfeit your confidence ? " have to assure him that it be not so and pacify him by give him a considerable part of his old wardrobe , the outfit have now all arrive . be of interest to me . she be a heavy , solid person , very limit , intensely respectable , and incline to be puritanical . you could hardly conceive a less emotional subject . yet i have tell you how , on the first night here , i hear her sob bitterly , and since then i have more than once observe trace of tear upon her face . some deep sorrow gnaw ever at her heart . sometimes i wonder if she have a guilty memory which haunt her , and sometimes i suspect of be a domestic tyrant . i have always feel that there be something singular and questionable in this man 's character , but the adventure of last night bring all my suspicion to a head . and yet it may seem a small matter in itself . you be aware that i be not a very sound sleeper , and since i have be on guard in this house my slumber have be light than ever . last night , about two in the morning , i be arouse by a stealthy step pass my room . i rise , open my door , and peep out . a long black shadow be trail down the corridor . it be throw by a man who walk softly down the passage with a candle hold in his hand . he be in shirt and trouser , with no cover to his foot . i could merely see the outline , but his height tell me that it be . he walk very slowly and circumspectly , and there be something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance . i have tell you that the corridor be break by the balcony which run round the hall , but that it be resume upon the farther side . i wait until he have pass out of sight and then i follow him . when i come round the balcony he have reach the end of the farther corridor , and i could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he have enter one of the room . now , all these room be unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition become more mysterious than ever . the light shine steadily as if he be stand motionless . i creep down the passage as noiselessly as i could and peep round the corner of the door . be crouch at the window with the candle hold against the glass . his profile be half turn towards me , and his face seem to be rigid with expectation as he stare out into the blackness of the moor . for some minute he stand watch intently . then he give a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light . instantly i make my way back to my room , and very shortly come the stealthy step pass once more upon their return journey . long afterwards when i have fall into a light sleep i hear a key turn somewhere in a lock , but i could not tell whence the sound come . what it all mean i can guess , but there be some secret business go on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of . i do not trouble you with my theory , for you ask me to furnish you only with fact . i have have a long talk with this morning , and we have make a plan of campaign found upon my observation of last night . i will not speak about it just now , but it should make my next report interesting reading . , 15th . my : if i be compel to leave you without much news during the early day of my mission you must acknowledge that i be make up for lose time , and that event be now crowd thick and fast upon us . in my last report i end upon my top note with at the window , and now i have quite a budget already which will , unless i be much mistake , considerably surprise you . thing have take a turn which i could not have anticipate . in some way they have within the last hour become much clear and in some way they have become more complicated . but i will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself . before breakfast on the morning follow my adventure i go down the corridor and examine the room in which have be on the night before . the western window through which he have stare so intently have , i notice , one peculiarity above all other window in the command the near outlook on to the moor . there be an opening between two tree which enable one from this point of view to look right down upon it , while from all the other window it be only a distant glimpse which can be obtain . it follow , therefore , that , since only this window would serve the purpose , must have be look out for something or somebody upon the moor . the night be very dark , so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hope to see anyone . it have strike me that it be possible that some love intrigue be on foot . that would have account for his stealthy movement and also for the uneasiness of his wife . the man be a fellow , very well equip to steal the heart of a country girl , so that this theory seem to have something to support it . that opening of the door which i have hear after i have return to my room might mean that he have go out to keep some clandestine appointment . so i reason with myself in the morning , and i tell you the direction of my suspicion , however much the result may have show that they be unfounded . but whatever the true explanation of 's movement might be , i feel that the responsibility of keep them to myself until i could explain them be more than i could bear . i have an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast , and i tell him all that i have see . he be less surprise than i have expect . " i know that walk about night , and i have a mind to speak to him about it , " say he . " two or three time i have hear his step in the passage , come and go , just about the hour you name . " " perhaps then he pay a visit every night to that particular window , " i suggest . " perhaps he do . if so , we should be able to shadow him and see what it be that he be after . i wonder what your friend would do if he be here . " " i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest , " say " he would follow and see what he do . " " then we shall do it together . " " but surely he would hear us . " " the man be rather deaf , and in any case we must take our chance of that . we will sit up in my room tonight and wait until he pass . " rub his hand with pleasure , and it be evident that he hail the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor . the baronet have be in communication with the architect who prepare the plan for , and with a contractor from , so that we may expect great change to begin here soon . there have be decorator and furnisher up from , and it be evident that our friend have large idea and mean to spare no pain or expense to restore the grandeur of his family . when the house be renovate and , all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete . between ourselves there be pretty clear sign that this will not be want if the lady be willing , for i have seldom see a man more infatuated with a woman than he be with our beautiful neighbour , . and yet the course of true love do not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstance expect . today , for example , its surface be break by a very unexpected ripple , which have cause our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance . after the conversation which i have quote about , put on his hat and prepare to go out . as a matter of course i do the same . " what , be you come , ? " he ask , look at me in a curious way . " that depend on whether you be go on the moor , " say " yes , i be . " " well , you know what my instruction be . i be sorry to intrude , but you hear how earnestly insist that i should not leave you , and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor . " put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile . " my dear fellow , " say he , " , with all his wisdom , do not foresee some thing which have happen since i have be on the moor . you understand me ? i be sure that you be the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport . i must go out alone . " it put me in a most awkward position . i be at a loss what to say or what to do , and before i have make up my mind he pick up his cane and be go . but when i come to think the matter over my conscience reproach me bitterly for have on any pretext allow him to go out of my sight . i imagine what my feeling would be if i have to return to you and to confess that some misfortune have occur through my disregard for your instruction . i assure you my cheek flush at the very think . it might not even now be too late to overtake him , so i set off at once in the direction of . i hurry along the road at the top of my speed without see anything of , until i come to the point where the moor path branch off . there , fear that perhaps i have come in the wrong direction after all , i mount a hill from which i could command a same hill which be cut into the dark quarry . thence i see him at once . he be on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off , and a lady be by his side who could only be . it be clear that there be already an understanding between them and that they have meet by appointment . they be walk slowly along in deep conversation , and i see her make quick little movement of her hand as if she be very earnest in what she be say , while he listen intently , and once or twice shake his head in strong dissent . i stand among the rock watch them , very much puzzle as to what i should do next . to follow them and break into their intimate conversation seem to be an outrage , and yet my clear duty be never for an instant to let him out of my sight . to act the spy upon a friend be a hateful task . still , i could see no good course than to observe him from the hill , and to clear my conscience by confess to him afterwards what i have do . it be true that if any sudden danger have threaten him i be too far away to be of use , and yet i be sure that you will agree with me that the position be very difficult , and that there be nothing more which i could do . our friend , , and the lady have halt on the path and be stand deeply absorb in their conversation , when i be suddenly aware that i be not the only witness of their interview . a wisp of green float in the air catch my eye , and another glance show me that it be carry on a stick by a man who be move among the break ground . it be with his . he be very much closer to the pair than i be , and he appear to be move in their direction . at this instant suddenly draw to his side . his arm be round her , but it seem to me that she be strain away from him with her face avert . he stoop his head to hers , and she raise one hand as if in protest . next moment i see them spring apart and turn hurriedly round . be the cause of the interruption . he be run wildly towards them , his absurd net dangle behind him . he gesticulate and almost dance with excitement in front of the lover . what the scene mean i could not imagine , but it seem to me that be abuse , who offer explanation , which become more angry as the other refuse to accept them . the lady stand by in haughty silence . finally turn upon his heel and beckon in a peremptory way to his sister , who , after an irresolute glance at , walk off by the side of her brother . the naturalist 's angry gesture show that the lady be include in his displeasure . the baronet stand for a minute look after them , and then he walk slowly back the way that he have come , his head hanging , the very picture of dejection . what all this mean i could not imagine , but i be deeply ashamed to have witness so intimate a scene without my friend 's knowledge . i run down the hill therefore and meet the baronet at the bottom . his face be flush with anger and his brow be wrinkle , like one who be at his wit 's end what to do . " halloa , ! where have you drop from ? " say he . " you do n't mean to say that you come after me in spite of all ? " i explain everything to him : how i have find it impossible to remain behind , how i have follow him , and how i have witness all that have occur . for an instant his eye blaze at me , but my frankness disarm his anger , and he break at last into a rather rueful laugh . " you would have think the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private , " say he , " but , by thunder , the whole countryside seem to have be out to see me do my a mighty poor wooing at that ! where have you engage a seat ? " " i be on that hill . " " quite in the back row , ? but her brother be well up to the front . do you see him come out on us ? " " yes , i do . " " do he ever strike you as be brother of hers ? " " i ca n't say that he ever do . " " i dare say not . i always think him sane enough until today , but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a straitjacket . what be the matter with me , anyhow ? you have live near me for some week , . tell me straight , now ! be there anything that would prevent me from make a good husband to a woman that i love ? " " i should say not . " " he ca n't object to my worldly position , so it must be myself that he have this down on . what have he against me ? i never hurt man or woman in my life that i know of . and yet he would not so much as let me touch the tip of her finger . " " do he say so ? " " that , and a deal more . i tell you , , i have only know her these few week , but from the first i just feel that she be make for me , and she , be happy when she be with me , and that i will swear . there be a light in a woman 's eye that speak louder than word . but he have never let us get together and it be only today for the first time that i see a chance of have a few word with her alone . she be glad to meet me , but when she do it be not love that she would talk about , and she would n't have let me talk about it either if she could have stop it . she keep come back to it that this be a place of danger , and that she would never be happy until i have leave it . i tell her that since i have see her i be in no hurry to leave it , and that if she really want me to go , the only way to work it be for her to arrange to go with me . with that i offer in as many word to marry her , but before she could answer , down come this brother of hers , run at us with a face on him like a madman . he be just white with rage , and those light eye of his be blaze with fury . what be i do with the lady ? how dare i offer her attention which be distasteful to her ? do i think that because i be a baronet i could do what i like ? if he have not be her brother i should have know well how to answer him . as it be i tell him that my feeling towards his sister be such as i be not ashamed of , and that i hope that she might honour me by become my wife . that seem to make the matter no well , so then i lose my temper too , and i answer him rather more hotly than i should perhaps , consider that she be stand by . so it end by his go off with her , as you see , and here be i as badly puzzle a man as any in this county . just tell me what it all mean , , and i will owe you more than ever i can hope to pay . " i try one or two explanation , but , indeed , i be completely puzzle myself . our friend 's title , his fortune , his age , his character , and his appearance be all in his favour , and i know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which run in his family . that his advance should be reject so brusquely without any reference to the lady 's own wish and that the lady should accept the situation without protest be very amazing . however , our conjecture be set at rest by a visit from himself that very afternoon . he have come to offer apology for his rudeness of the morning , and after a long private interview with in his study the upshot of their conversation be that the breach be quite heal , and that we be to dine at next as a sign of it . " i do n't say now that he be n't a crazy man , " say ; " i ca n't forget the look in his eye when he run at me this morning , but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he have do . " " do he give any explanation of his conduct ? " " his sister be everything in his life , he say . that be natural enough , and i be glad that he should understand her value . they have always be together , and accord to his account he have be a very lonely man with only her as a companion , so that the thought of lose her be really terrible to him . he have not understand , he say , that i be become attach to her , but when he see with his own eye that it be really so , and that she might be take away from him , it give him such a shock that for a time he be not responsible for what he say or do . he be very sorry for all that have pass , and he recognize how foolish and how selfish it be that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life . if she have to leave him he have rather it be to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else . but in any case it be a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it . he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three month to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivate the lady 's friendship during that time without claim her love . this i promise , and so the matter rest . " so there be one of our small mystery clear up . it be something to have touch bottom anywhere in this bog in which we be flounder . we know now why look with disfavour upon his sister be when that suitor be so eligible a one as . and now i pass on to another thread which i have extricate out of the tangled skein , the mystery of the sob in the night , of the face of , of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window . congratulate me , my dear , and tell me that i have not disappoint you as an you do not regret the confidence which you show in me when you send me down . all these thing have by one night 's work be thoroughly clear . i have say " by one night 's work , " but , in truth , it be by two night ' work , for on the first we draw entirely blank . i sit up with in his room until nearly three o'clock in the morning , but no sound of any sort do we hear except the chime clock upon the stair . it be a most melancholy vigil and end by each of us fall asleep in our chair . fortunately we be not discourage , and we determine to try again . the next night we lower the lamp and sit smoking cigarette without make the least sound . it be incredible how slowly the hour crawl by , and yet we be help through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watch the trap into which he hope the game may wander . one strike , and two , and we have almost for the second time give it up in despair when in an instant we both sit bolt upright in our chair with all our weary sense keenly on the alert once more . we have hear the creak of a step in the passage . very stealthily we hear it pass along until it die away in the distance . then the baronet gently open his door and we set out in pursuit . already our man have go round the gallery and the corridor be all in darkness . softly we steal along until we have come into the other wing . we be just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall , figure , his shoulder round as he tiptoe down the passage . then he pass through the same door as before , and the light of the candle frame it in the darkness and shoot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor . we shuffle cautiously towards it , try every plank before we dare to put our whole weight upon it . we have take the precaution of leave our boot behind us , but , even so , the old board snap and creak beneath our tread . sometimes it seem impossible that he should fail to hear our approach . however , the man be fortunately rather deaf , and he be entirely preoccupy in that which he be do . when at last we reach the door and peep through we find him crouch at the window , candle in hand , his white , intent face press against the pane , exactly as i have see him two night before . we have arrange no plan of campaign , but the baronet be a man to whom the most direct way be always the most natural . he walk into the room , and as he do so spring up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stand , livid and tremble , before us . his dark eye , glare out of the white mask of his face , be full of horror and astonishment as he gaze from to me . " what be you do here , ? " " nothing , sir . " his agitation be so great that he could hardly speak , and the shadow spring up and down from the shake of his candle . " it be the window , sir . i go round at night to see that they be fasten . " " on the second floor ? " " yes , sir , all the window . " " look here , , " say sternly , " we have make up our mind to have the truth out of you , so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later . come , now ! no lie ! what be you do at that window ? " the fellow look at us in a helpless way , and he wring his hand together like one who be in the last extremity of doubt and misery . " i be do no harm , sir . i be hold a candle to the window . " " and why be you hold a candle to the window ? " " do n't ask me , n't ask me ! i give you my word , sir , that it be not my secret , and that i can tell it . if it concern no one but myself i would not try to keep it from you . " a sudden idea occur to me , and i take the candle from the tremble hand of the butler . " he must have be hold it as a signal , " say " let us see if there be any answer . " i hold it as he have do , and stare out into the darkness of the night . vaguely i could discern the black bank of the tree and the light expanse of the moor , for the moon be behind the cloud . and then i give a cry of exultation , for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light have suddenly transfix the dark veil , and glow steadily in the centre of the black square frame by the window . " there it be ! " i cry . " no , no , sir , it be at all ! " the butler break in ; " i assure you , -- " " move your light across the window , ! " cry the baronet . " see , the other move also ! now , you rascal , do you deny that it be a signal ? come , speak up ! who be your confederate out yonder , and what be this conspiracy that be go on ? " the man 's face become openly defiant . " it be my business , and not yours . i will not tell . " " then you leave my employment right away . " " very good , sir . if i must i must . " " and you go in disgrace . by thunder , you may well be ashamed of yourself . your family have live with mine for over a hundred year under this roof , and here i find you deep in some dark plot against me . " " no , no , sir ; no , not against you ! " it be a woman 's voice , and , pale and more horror-struck than her husband , be stand at the door . her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have be comic be it not for the intensity of feel upon her face . " we have to go , . this be the end of it . you can pack our thing , " say the butler . " oh , , , have i bring you to this ? it be my doing , mine . he have do nothing except for my sake and because i ask him . " " speak out , then ! what do it mean ? " " my unhappy brother be starve on the moor . we can let him perish at our very gate . the light be a signal to him that food be ready for him , and his light out yonder be to show the spot to which to bring it . " " then your brother -- " " the escape convict , , the criminal . " " that be the truth , sir , " say . " i say that it be not my secret and that i could not tell it to you . but now you have hear it , and you will see that if there be a plot it be not against you . " this , then , be the explanation of the stealthy expedition at night and the light at the window . and i both stare at the woman in amazement . be it possible that this stolidly respectable person be of the same blood as one of the most notorious criminal in the country ? " yes , sir , my name be , and he be my young brother . we humour him too much when he be a lad and give him his own way in everything until he come to think that the world be make for his pleasure , and that he could do what he like in it . then as he grow old he meet wicked companion , and the devil enter into him until he break my mother 's heart and drag our name in the dirt . from crime to crime he sink low and low until it be only the mercy of which have snatch him from the scaffold ; but to me , sir , he be always the little boy that i have nurse and play with as an elder sister would . that be why he break prison , sir . he know that i be here and that we could not refuse to help him . when he drag himself here one night , weary and starve , with the warder hard at his heel , what could we do ? we take him in and feed him and care for him . then you return , sir , and my brother think he would be safe on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry be over , so he lie in hide there . but every second night we make sure if he be still there by put a light in the window , and if there be an answer my husband take out some bread and meat to him . every day we hope that he be go , but as long as he be there we could not desert him . that be the whole truth , as i be an honest christian woman and you will see that if there be blame in the matter it do not lie with my husband but with me , for whose sake he have do all that he have . " the woman 's word come with an intense earnestness which carry conviction with them . " be this true , ? " " yes , . every word of it . " " well , i can blame you for stand by your own wife . forget what i have say . go to your room , you two , and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning . " when they be go we look out of the window again . have fling it open , and the cold night wind beat in upon our face . far away in the black distance there still glow that one tiny point of yellow light . " i wonder he dare , " say . " it may be so place as to be only visible from here . " " very likely . how far do you think it be ? " " out by the , i think . " " not more than a mile or two off . " " hardly that . " " well , it can be far if have to carry out the food to it . and he be wait , this villain , beside that candle . by thunder , , i be go out to take that man ! " the same thought have cross my own mind . it be not as if the have take us into their confidence . their secret have be force from them . the man be a danger to the community , an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there be neither pity nor excuse . we be only do our duty in take this chance of put him back where he could do no harm . with his brutal and violent nature , other would have to pay the price if we hold our hand . any night , for example , our neighbour the might be attack by him , and it may have be the thought of this which make so keen upon the adventure . " i will come , " say " then get your revolver and put on your boot . the sooner we start the good , as the fellow may put out his light and be off . " in five minute we be outside the door , start upon our expedition . we hurry through the dark shrubbery , amid the dull moan of the autumn wind and the rustle of the fall leave . the night air be heavy with the smell of damp and decay . now and again the moon peep out for an instant , but cloud be drive over the face of the sky , and just as we come out on the moor a thin rain begin to fall . the light still burn steadily in front . " be you arm ? " i ask . " i have a hunting-crop . " " we must close in on him rapidly , for he be say to be a desperate fellow . we shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist . " " i say , , " say the baronet , " what would say to this ? how about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil be exalt ? " as if in answer to his word there rise suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which i have already hear upon the border of the great . it come with the wind through the silence of the night , a long , deep mutter , then a rise howl , and then the sad moan in which it die away . again and again it sound , the whole air throb with it , strident , wild , and menace . the baronet catch my sleeve and his face glimmer white through the darkness . " my , what be that , ? " " i do n't know . it be a sound they have on the moor . i hear it once before . " it die away , and an absolute silence close in upon us . we stand strain our ear , but nothing come . " , " say the baronet , " it be the cry of a hound . " my blood run cold in my vein , for there be a break in his voice which tell of the sudden horror which have seize him . " what do they call this sound ? " he ask . " who ? " " the folk on the countryside . " " oh , they be ignorant people . why should you mind what they call it ? " " tell me , . what do they say of it ? " i hesitate but could not escape the question . " they say it be the cry of the hound of the . " he groan and be silent for a few moment . " a hound it be , " he say at last , " but it seem to come from mile away , over yonder , i think . " " it be hard to say whence it come . " " it rise and fall with the wind . be n't that the direction of the great ? " " yes , it be . " " well , it be up there . come now , , do n't you think yourself that it be the cry of a hound ? i be not a child . you need not fear to speak the truth . " " be with me when i hear it last . he say that it might be the calling of a strange bird . " " no , no , it be a hound . , can there be some truth in all these storey ? be it possible that i be really in danger from so dark a cause ? you do n't believe it , do you , ? " " no , no . " " and yet it be one thing to laugh about it in , and it be another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that . and my uncle ! there be the footprint of the hound beside him as he lie . it all fit together . i do n't think that i be a coward , , but that sound seem to freeze my very blood . feel my hand ! " it be as cold as a block of marble . " you will be all right tomorrow . " " i do n't think i will get that cry out of my head . what do you advise that we do now ? " " shall we turn back ? " " no , by thunder ; we have come out to get our man , and we will do it . we after the convict , and a , as likely as not , after us . come on ! we will see it through if all the fiend of the pit be loose upon the moor . " we stumble slowly along in the darkness , with the black loom of the craggy hill around us , and the yellow speck of light burning steadily in front . there be nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon a pitch-dark night , and sometimes the glimmer seem to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might have be within a few yard of us . but at last we could see whence it come , and then we know that we be indeed very close . a guttering candle be stick in a crevice of the rock which flank it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from be visible , save in the direction of . a boulder of granite conceal our approach , and crouch behind it we gaze over it at the signal light . it be strange to see this single candle burn there in the middle of the moor , with no sign of life near the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it . " what shall we do now ? " whisper . " wait here . he must be near his light . let us see if we can get a glimpse of him . " the word be hardly out of my mouth when we both see him . over the rock , in the crevice of which the candle burn , there be thrust out an evil yellow face , a terrible animal face , all seam and score with vile passion . foul with mire , with a bristle beard , and hang with matted hair , it might well have belong to one of those old savage who dwell in the burrow on the hillside . the light beneath him be reflect in his small , cunning eye which peer fiercely to right and leave through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who have hear the step of the hunter . something have evidently arouse his suspicion . it may have be that have some private signal which we have neglect to give , or the fellow may have have some other reason for think that all be not well , but i could read his fear upon his wicked face . any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness . i spring forward therefore , and do the same . at the same moment the convict scream out a curse at us and hurl a rock which splinter up against the boulder which have shelter us . i catch one glimpse of his short , squat , strongly build figure as he spring to his foot and turn to run . at the same moment by a lucky chance the moon break through the cloud . we rush over the brow of the hill , and there be our man run with great speed down the other side , spring over the stone in his way with the activity of a mountain goat . a lucky long shot of my revolver might have cripple him , but i have bring it only to defend myself if attack and not to shoot an unarmed man who be run away . we be both swift runner and in fairly good training , but we soon find that we have no chance of overtake him . we see him for a long time in the moonlight until he be only a small speck move swiftly among the boulder upon the side of a distant hill . we run and run until we be completely blow , but the space between us grow ever wide . finally we stop and sit pant on two rock , while we watch him disappear in the distance . and it be at this moment that there occur a most strange and unexpected thing . we have rise from our rock and be turn to go home , have abandon the hopeless chase . the moon be low upon the right , and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stand up against the low curve of its silver disc . there , outline as black as an ebony statue on that shine background , i see the figure of a man upon the tor . do not think that it be a delusion , . i assure you that i have never in my life see anything more clearly . as far as i could judge , the figure be that of a tall , thin man . he stand with his leg a little separate , his arm fold , his head bow , as if he be brood over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lie before him . he might have be the very spirit of that terrible place . it be not the convict . this man be far from the place where the latter have disappear . besides , he be a much tall man . with a cry of surprise i point him out to the baronet , but in the instant during which i have turn to grasp his arm the man be go . there be the sharp pinnacle of granite still cut the low edge of the moon , but its peak bear no trace of that silent and motionless figure . i wish to go in that direction and to search the tor , but it be some distance away . the baronet 's nerve be still quiver from that cry , which recall the dark story of his family , and he be not in the mood for fresh adventure . he have not see this lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding attitude have give to me . " a warder , no doubt , " say he . " the moor have be thick with them since this fellow escape . " well , perhaps his explanation may be the right one , but i should like to have some further proof of it . today we mean to communicate to the people where they should look for their missing man , but it be hard line that we have not actually have the triumph of bring him back as our own prisoner . such be the adventure of last night , and you must acknowledge , my dear , that i have do you very well in the matter of a report . much of what i tell you be no doubt quite irrelevant , but still i feel that it be good that i should let you have all the fact and leave you to select for yourself those which will be of most service to you in help you to your conclusion . we be certainly make some progress . so far as the go we have find the motive of their action , and that have clear up the situation very much . but the moor with its mystery and its strange inhabitant remain as inscrutable as ever . perhaps in my next i may be able to throw some light upon this also . good of all would it be if you could come down to us . in any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next few day . so far i have be able to quote from the report which i have forward during these early day to . now , however , i have arrive at a point in my narrative where i be compel to abandon this method and to trust once more to my recollection , aid by the diary which i keep at the time . a few extract from the latter will carry me on to those scene which be indelibly fix in every detail upon my memory . i proceed , then , from the morning which follow our abortive chase of the convict and our other strange experience upon the moor . 16th . a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain . the house be bank in with rolling cloud , which rise now and then to show the dreary curve of the moor , with thin , silver vein upon the side of the hill , and the distant boulder gleam where the light strike upon their wet face . it be melancholy outside and in . the baronet be in a black reaction after the excitement of the night . i be conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending present danger , which be the more terrible because i be unable to define it . and have i not cause for such a feeling ? consider the long sequence of incident which have all point to some sinister influence which be at work around us . there be the death of the last occupant of the , fulfill so exactly the condition of the family legend , and there be the repeated report from peasant of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor . twice i have with my own ear hear the sound which resemble the distant bay of a hound . it be incredible , impossible , that it should really be outside the ordinary law of nature . a spectral hound which leave material footmark and fill the air with its howl be surely not to be think of . may fall in with such a superstition , and also , but if i have one quality upon earth it be common sense , and nothing will persuade me to believe in such a thing . to do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasant , who be not content with a mere fiend dog but must needs describe him with shoot from his mouth and eye . would not listen to such fancy , and i be his agent . but fact be fact , and i have twice hear this cry upon the moor . suppose that there be really some huge hound loose upon it ; that would go far to explain everything . but where could such a hound lie conceal , where do it get its food , where do it come from , how be it that no one see it by day ? it must be confess that the natural explanation offer almost as many difficulty as the other . and always , apart from the hound , there be the fact of the human agency in , the man in the cab , and the letter which warn against the moor . this at least be real , but it might have be the work of a protect friend as easily as of an enemy . where be that friend or enemy now ? have he remain in , or have he follow us down here ? could he be the stranger whom i see upon the tor ? it be true that i have have only the one glance at him , and yet there be some thing to which i be ready to swear . he be no one whom i have see down here , and i have now meet all the neighbour . the figure be far tall than that of , far thin than that of . it might possibly have be , but we have leave him behind us , and i be certain that he could not have follow us . a stranger then be still dog us , just as a stranger dog us in . we have never shake him off . if i could lay my hand upon that man , then at last we might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulty . to this one purpose i must now devote all my energy . my first impulse be to tell all my plan . my second and wise one be to play my own game and speak as little as possible to anyone . he be silent and distrait . his nerve have be strangely shake by that sound upon the moor . i will say nothing to add to his anxiety , but i will take my own step to attain my own end . we have a small scene this morning after breakfast . ask leave to speak with , and they be closet in his study some little time . sit in the billiard-room i more than once hear the sound of voice raise , and i have a pretty good idea what the point be which be under discussion . after a time the baronet open his door and call for me . " consider that he have a grievance , " he say . " he think that it be unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he , of his own free will , have tell us the secret . " the butler be stand very pale but very collect before us . " i may have speak too warmly , sir , " say he , " and if i have , i be sure that i beg your pardon . at the same time , i be very much surprise when i hear you two gentleman come back this morning and learn that you have be chase . the poor fellow have enough to fight against without my put more upon his track . " " if you have tell us of your own free will it would have be a different thing , " say the baronet , " you only tell us , or rather your wife only tell us , when it be force from you and you could not help yourself . " " i do n't think you would have take advantage of it , i do n't . " " the man be a public danger . there be lonely house scatter over the moor , and he be a fellow who would stick at nothing . you only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that . look at 's house , for example , with no one but himself to defend it . there be no safety for anyone until he be under lock and key . " " he will break into no house , sir . i give you my solemn word upon that . but he will never trouble anyone in this country again . i assure you , , that in a very few day the necessary arrangement will have be make and he will be on his way to . for 's sake , sir , i beg of you not to let the police know that he be still on the moor . they have give up the chase there , and he can lie quiet until the ship be ready for him . you ca n't tell on him without get my wife and me into trouble . i beg you , sir , to say nothing to the police . " " what do you say , ? " i shrug my shoulder . " if he be safely out of the country it would relieve the tax-payer of a burden . " " but how about the chance of his holding someone up before he go ? " " he would not do anything so mad , sir . we have provide him with all that he can want . to commit a crime would be to show where he be hide . " " that be true , " say . " well , -- " " bless you , sir , and thank you from my heart ! it would have kill my poor wife have he be take again . " " i guess we be aid and abet a felony , ? but , after what we have hear i do n't feel as if i could give the man up , so there be an end of it . all right , , you can go . " with a few break word of gratitude the man turn , but he hesitate and then come back . " you have be so kind to us , sir , that i should like to do the good i can for you in return . i know something , , and perhaps i should have say it before , but it be long after the inquest that i find it out . i have never breathe a word about it yet to mortal man . it be about poor 's death . " the baronet and i be both upon our foot . " do you know how he die ? " " no , sir , i do n't know that . " " what then ? " " i know why he be at the gate at that hour . it be to meet a woman . " " to meet a woman ! he ? " " yes , sir . " " and the woman 's name ? " " i ca n't give you the name , sir , but i can give you the initial . her initial be " " how do you know this , ? " " well , , your uncle have a letter that morning . he have usually a great many letter , for he be a public man and well know for his kind heart , so that everyone who be in trouble be glad to turn to him . but that morning , as it chance , there be only this one letter , so i take the more notice of it . it be from , and it be address in a woman 's hand . " " well ? " " well , sir , i think no more of the matter , and never would have do have it not be for my wife . only a few week ago she be clean out 's have never be touch since his she find the ash of a burned letter in the back of the grate . the great part of it be char to piece , but one little slip , the end of a page , hang together , and the writing could still be read , though it be gray on a black ground . it seem to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter and it say : ' please , please , as you be a gentleman , burn this letter , and be at the gate by ten o clock . beneath it be sign the initial " " you get that slip ? " " no , sir , it crumble all to bit after we move it . " " have receive any other letter in the same writing ? " " well , sir , i take no particular notice of his letter . i should not have notice this one , only it happen to come alone . " " and you have no idea who be ? " " no , sir . no more than you have . but i expect if we could lay our hand upon that lady we should know more about 's death . " " i can understand , , how you come to conceal this important information . " " well , sir , it be immediately after that our own trouble come to us . and then again , sir , we be both of us very fond of , as we well might be consider all that he have do for us . to rake this up could n't help our poor master , and it be well to go carefully when there be a lady in the case . even the good of -- " " you think it might injure his reputation ? " " well , sir , i think no good could come of it . but now you have be kind to us , and i feel as if it would be treat you unfairly not to tell you all that i know about the matter . " " very good , ; you can go . " when the butler have leave us turn to me . " well , , what do you think of this new light ? " " it seem to leave the darkness rather black than before . " " so i think . but if we can only trace it should clear up the whole business . we have gain that much . we know that there be someone who have the fact if we can only find her . what do you think we should do ? " " let know all about it at once . it will give him the clue for which he have be seek . i be much mistaken if it do not bring him down . " i go at once to my room and draw up my report of the morning 's conversation for . it be evident to me that he have be very busy of late , for the note which i have from be few and short , with no comment upon the information which i have supply and hardly any reference to my mission . no doubt his blackmail case be absorb all his faculty . and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest . i wish that he be here . 17th . all day today the rain pour down , rustle on the ivy and drip from the eaves . i think of the convict out upon the bleak , cold , shelterless moor . poor devil ! whatever his crime , he have suffer something to atone for them . and then i think of that other face in the cab , the figure against the moon . be he also out in that unseen watcher , the man of darkness ? in the evening i put on my waterproof and i walk far upon the sodden moor , full of dark , the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistle about my ear . help those who wander into the great mire now , for even the firm upland be become a morass . i find the black tor upon which i have see the solitary watcher , and from its craggy summit i look out myself across the melancholy down . rain squall drift across their russet face , and the heavy , cloud hang low over the landscape , trail in gray wreath down the side of the fantastic hill . in the distant hollow on the left , half hide by the mist , the two thin tower of rise above the tree . they be the only sign of human life which i could see , save only those prehistoric hut which lie thickly upon the slope of the hill . nowhere be there any trace of that lonely man whom i have see on the same spot two night before . as i walk back i be overtake by drive in his dog-cart over a rough moorland track which lead from the outlying farmhouse of . he have be very attentive to us , and hardly a day have pass that he have not call at the to see how we be get on . he insist upon my climbing into his dog-cart , and he give me a lift homeward . i find him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel . it have wander on to the moor and have never come back . i give him such consolation as i might , but i think of the pony on the , and i do not fancy that he will see his little dog again . " by the way , , " say i as we jolt along the rough road , " i suppose there be few people live within drive distance of this whom you do not know ? " " hardly any , i think . " " can you , then , tell me the name of any woman whose initial be ? " he think for a few minute . " no , " say he . " there be a few gipsy and labour folk for whom i ca n't answer , but among the farmer or gentry there be no one whose initial be those . wait a bit though , " he add after a pause . " there be initial be -- she live in . " " who be she ? " i ask . " she be 's daughter . " " what ! the crank ? " " exactly . she marry an artist name , who come sketch on the moor . he prove to be a blackguard and desert her . the fault from what i hear may not have be entirely on one side . her father refuse to have anything to do with her because she have marry without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reason as well . so , between the old sinner and the young one the girl have have a pretty bad time . " " how do she live ? " " i fancy old allow her a pittance , but it can be more , for his own affair be considerably involve . whatever she may have deserve one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad . her story get about , and several of the people here do something to enable her to earn an honest living . do for one , and for another . i give a trifle myself . it be to set her up in a typewriting business . " he want to know the object of my inquiry , but i manage to satisfy his curiosity without tell him too much , for there be no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence . tomorrow morning i shall find my way to , and if i can see this , of equivocal reputation , a long step will have be make towards clear one incident in this chain of mystery . i be certainly develop the wisdom of the serpent , for when press his question to an inconvenient extent i ask him casually to what type 's skull belong , and so hear nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive . i have not live for year with for nothing . i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day . this be my conversation with just now , which give me one more strong card which i can play in due time . have stay to dinner , and he and the baronet play afterwards . the butler bring me my coffee into the library , and i take the chance to ask him a few question . " well , " say i , " have this precious relation of yours departed , or be he still lurk out yonder ? " " i do n't know , sir . i hope to heaven that he have go , for he have bring nothing but trouble here ! i have not hear of him since i leave out food for him last , and that be three day ago . " " do you see him then ? " " no , sir , but the food be go when next i go that way . " " then he be certainly there ? " " so you would think , sir , unless it be the other man who take it . " i sit with my halfway to my lip and stare at . " you know that there be another man then ? " " yes , sir ; there be another man upon the moor . " " have you see him ? " " no , sir . " " how do you know of him then ? " " tell me of him , sir , a week ago or more . he be in hiding , too , but he be not a convict as far as i can make out . i do n't like it , tell you straight , sir , that i do n't like it . " he speak with a sudden passion of earnestness . " now , listen to me , ! i have no interest in this matter but that of your master . i have come here with no object except to help him . tell me , frankly , what it be that you do n't like . " hesitate for a moment , as if he regret his outburst or find it difficult to express his own feeling in word . " it be all these goings-on , sir , " he cry at last , wave his hand towards the window which face the moor . " there be foul play somewhere , and there be black villainy brewing , to that i will swear ! very glad i should be , sir , to see on his way back to again ! " " but what be it that alarm you ? " " look at 's death ! that be bad enough , for all that the coroner say . look at the noise on the moor at night . there be not a man would cross it after sundown if he be pay for it . look at this stranger hide out yonder , and watch and wait ! what be he wait for ? what do it mean ? it mean no good to anyone of the name of , and very glad i shall be to be quit of it all on the day that 's new servant be ready to take over the . " " but about this stranger , " say " can you tell me anything about him ? what do say ? do he find out where he hide , or what he be do ? " " he see him once or twice , but he be a deep one and give nothing away . at first he think that he be the police , but soon he find that he have some lay of his own . a kind of gentleman he be , as far as he could see , but what he be do he could not make out . " " and where do he say that he live ? " " among the old house on the stone hut where the old folk use to live . " " but how about his food ? " " find out that he have get a lad who work for him and bring all he need . i dare say he go to for what he want . " " very good , . we may talk further of this some other time . " when the butler have go i walk over to the black window , and i look through a blur pane at the drive cloud and at the toss outline of the wind-swept tree . it be a wild night indoors , and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor . what passion of hatred can it be which lead a man to lurk in such a place at such a time ! and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which call for such a trial ! there , in that hut upon the moor , seem to lie the very centre of that problem which have vex me so sorely . i swear that another day shall not have pass before i have do all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery . the extract from my private diary which form the last chapter have bring my narrative up to the eighteenth of , a time when these strange event begin to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion . the incident of the next few day be indelibly grave upon my recollection , and i can tell them without reference to the note make at the time . i start them from the day which succeed that upon which i have establish two fact of great importance , the one that of have write to and make an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he meet his death , the other that the lurk man upon the moor be to be find among the stone hut upon the hillside . with these two fact in my possession i feel that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if i could not throw some further light upon these dark place . i have no opportunity to tell the baronet what i have learn about upon the evening before , for remain with him at card until it be very late . at breakfast , however , i inform him about my discovery and ask him whether he would care to accompany me to . at first he be very eager to come , but on second thought it seem to both of us that if i go alone the result might be good . the more formal we make the visit the less information we might obtain . i leave behind , therefore , not without some of conscience , and drive off upon my new quest . when i reach i tell to put up the horse , and i make inquiry for the lady whom i have come to interrogate . i have no difficulty in find her room , which be central and well appoint . a maid show me in without ceremony , and as i enter the sitting-room a lady , who be sit before a typewriter , spring up with a pleasant smile of welcome . her face fall , however , when she see that i be a stranger , and she sit down again and ask me the object of my visit . the first impression leave by be one of extreme beauty . her eye and hair be of the same rich hazel colour , and her cheek , though considerably freckled , be flush with the exquisite bloom of the brunette , the dainty pink which lurk at the heart of the sulphur rise . admiration be , i repeat , the first impression . but the second be criticism . there be something subtly wrong with the face , some coarseness of expression , some hardness , perhaps , of eye , some looseness of lip which mar its perfect beauty . but these , of course , be afterthought . at the moment i be simply conscious that i be in the presence of a very handsome woman , and that she be ask me the reason for my visit . i have not quite understand until that instant how delicate my mission be . " i have the pleasure , " say i , " of know your father . " it be a clumsy introduction , and the lady make me feel it . " there be nothing in common between my father and me , " she say . " i owe him nothing , and his friend be not mine . if it be not for the late and some other kind heart i might have starve for all that my father care . " " it be about the late that i have come here to see you . " the freckle start out on the lady 's face . " what can i tell you about him ? " she ask , and her finger play nervously over the stop of her typewriter . " you know him , do you not ? " " i have already say that i owe a great deal to his kindness . if i be able to support myself it be largely due to the interest which he take in my unhappy situation . " " do you correspond with him ? " the lady look quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eye . " what be the object of these question ? " she ask sharply . " the object be to avoid a public scandal . it be well that i should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control . " she be silent and her face be still very pale . at last she look up with something reckless and defiant in her manner . " well , i will answer , " she say . " what be your question ? " " do you correspond with ? " " i certainly write to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity . " " have you the date of those letter ? " " no. " " you ever meet him ? " " yes , once or twice , when he come into . he be a very retire man , and he prefer to do good by stealth . " " but if you see him so seldom and write so seldom , how do he know enough about your affair to be able to help you , as you say that he have do ? " she meet my difficulty with the utmost readiness . " there be several gentleman who know my sad history and unite to help me . one be , a neighbour and intimate friend of 's . he be exceedingly kind , and it be through him that learn about my affair . " i know already that have make his almoner upon several occasion , so the lady 's statement bear the impress of truth upon it . " do you ever write to ask him to meet you ? " i continue . flush with anger again . " really , sir , this be a very extraordinary question . " " i be sorry , madam , but i must repeat it . " " then i answer , certainly not . " " not on the very day of 's death ? " the flush have fade in an instant , and a deathly face be before me . her dry lip could not speak the " no " which i see rather than hear . " surely your memory deceive you , " say " i could even quote a passage of your letter . it run ' please , please , as you be a gentleman , burn this letter , and be at the gate by ten o'clock . ' " i think that she have faint , but she recover herself by a supreme effort . " be there no such thing as a gentleman ? " she gasp . " you do an injustice . he do burn the letter . but sometimes a letter may be legible even when burn . you acknowledge now that you write it ? " " yes , i do write it , " she cry , pour out her soul in a torrent of word . " i do write it . why should i deny it ? i have no reason to be ashamed of it . i wish him to help me . i believe that if i have an interview i could gain his help , so i ask him to meet me . " " but why at such an hour ? " " because i have only just learn that he be go to next day and might be away for month . there be reason why i could not get there earlier . " " but why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house ? " " do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor 's house ? " " well , what happen when you do get there ? " " i never go . " " ! " " no , i swear it to you on all i hold sacred . i never go . something intervene to prevent my go . " " what be that ? " " that be a private matter . i can tell it . " " you acknowledge then that you make an appointment with at the very hour and place at which he meet his death , but you deny that you keep the appointment . " " that be the truth . " again and again i cross-question her , but i could never get past that point . " , " say i as i rise from this long and inconclusive interview , " you be take a very great responsibility and put yourself in a very false position by not make an absolutely clean breast of all that you know . if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you be compromise . if your position be innocent , why do you in the first instance deny have write to upon that date ? " " because i fear that some false conclusion might be draw from it and that i might find myself involve in a scandal . " " and why be you so press that should destroy your letter ? " " if you have read the letter you will know . " " i do not say that i have read all the letter . " " you quote some of it . " " i quote the postscript . the letter have , as i say , be burn and it be not all legible . i ask you once again why it be that you be so press that should destroy this letter which he receive on the day of his death . " " the matter be a very private one . " " the more reason why you should avoid a public investigation . " " i will tell you , then . if you have hear anything of my unhappy history you will know that i make a rash marriage and have reason to regret it . " " i have hear so much . " " my life have be one incessant persecution from a husband whom i abhor . the law be upon his side , and every day i be face by the possibility that he may force me to live with him . at the time that i write this letter to i have learn that there be a prospect of my regain my freedom if certain expense could be meet . it mean everything to of mind , happiness , . i know 's generosity , and i think that if he hear the story from my own lip he would help me . " " then how be it that you do not go ? " " because i receive help in the interval from another source . " " why then , do you not write to and explain this ? " " so i should have do have i not see his death in the paper next morning . " the woman 's story hang coherently together , and all my question be unable to shake it . i could only check it by find if she have , indeed , institute divorce proceeding against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy . it be unlikely that she would dare to say that she have not be to if she really have be , for a trap would be necessary to take her there , and could not have return to until the early hour of the morning . such an excursion could not be keep secret . the probability be , therefore , that she be tell the truth , or , at least , a part of the truth . i come away baffle and dishearten . once again i have reach that dead wall which seem to be build across every path by which i try to get at the object of my mission . and yet the more i think of the lady 's face and of her manner the more i feel that something be be hold back from me . why should she turn so pale ? why should she fight against every admission until it be force from her ? why should she have be so reticent at the time of the tragedy ? surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have me believe . for the moment i could proceed no farther in that direction , but must turn back to that other clue which be to be seek for among the stone hut upon the moor . and that be a most vague direction . i realize it as i drive back and note how hill after hill show trace of the ancient people . 's only indication have be that the stranger live in one of these abandon hut , and many hundred of them be scatter throughout the length and breadth of the moor . but i have my own experience for a guide since it have show me the man himself stand upon the summit of the . that , then , should be the centre of my search . from there i should explore every hut upon the moor until i light upon the right one . if this man be inside it i should find out from his own lip , at the point of my revolver if necessary , who he be and why he have dog us so long . he might slip away from us in the crowd of , but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor . on the other hand , if i should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it i must remain there , however long the vigil , until he return . have miss him in . it would indeed be a triumph for me if i could run him to earth where my master have fail . have be against us again and again in this inquiry , but now at last it come to my aid . and the messenger of good fortune be none other than , who be stand , and red-faced , outside the gate of his garden , which open on to the highroad along which i travel . " , , " cry he with unwonted good humour , " you must really give your horse a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratulate me . " my feeling towards him be very far from be friendly after what i have hear of his treatment of his daughter , but i be anxious to send and the wagonette home , and the opportunity be a good one . i alight and send a message to that i should walk over in time for dinner . then i follow into his dining-room . " it be a great day for me , of the day of my life , " he cry with many chuckle . " i have bring off a double event . i mean to teach them in these part that law be law , and that there be a man here who do not fear to invoke it . i have establish a right of way through the centre of old 's park , slap across it , sir , within a hundred yard of his own front door . what do you think of that ? we will teach these magnate that they can ride roughshod over the right of the commoner , confound them ! and i have close the wood where the folk use to picnic . these infernal people seem to think that there be no right of property , and that they can swarm where they like with their paper and their bottle . both case decide , , and both in my favour . i have n't have such a day since i have for trespass because he shoot in his own warren . " " how on earth do you do that ? " " look it up in the book , sir . it will repay v. , of 's . it cost me @card@ pound , but i get my verdict . " " do it do you any good ? " " none , sir , none . i be proud to say that i have no interest in the matter . i act entirely from a sense of public duty . i have no doubt , for example , that the people will burn me in effigy tonight . i tell the police last time they do it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibition . the be in a scandalous state , sir , and it have not afford me the protection to which i be entitle . the case of v. will bring the matter before the attention of the public . i tell them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me , and already my word have come true . " " how so ? " i ask . the old man put on a very know expression . " because i could tell them what they be die to know ; but nothing would induce me to help the rascal in any way . " i have be cast round for some excuse by which i could get away from his gossip , but now i begin to wish to hear more of it . i have see enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the sure way to stop his confidence . " some poach case , no doubt ? " say i with an indifferent manner . " , , my boy , a very much more important matter than that ! what about the convict on the moor ? " i stare . " you do n't mean that you know where he be ? " say " i may not know exactly where he be , but i be quite sure that i could help the police to lay their hand on him . have it never strike you that the way to catch that man be to find out where he get his food and so trace it to him ? " he certainly seem to be get uncomfortably near the truth . " no doubt , " say i ; " but how do you know that he be anywhere upon the moor ? " " i know it because i have see with my own eye the messenger who take him his food . " my heart sink for . it be a serious thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody . but his next remark take a weight from my mind . " you will be surprise to hear that his food be take to him by a child . i see him every day through my telescope upon the roof . he pass along the same path at the same hour , and to whom should he be go except to the convict ? " here be luck indeed ! and yet i suppress all appearance of interest . a child ! have say that our unknown be supply by a boy . it be on his track , and not upon the convict be , that have stumble . if i could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt . but incredulity and indifference be evidently my strong card . " i should say that it be much more likely that it be the son of one of the moorland shepherd take out his father 's dinner . " the least appearance of opposition strike fire out of the old autocrat . his eye look malignantly at me , and his gray whisker bristle like those of an angry cat . " indeed , sir ! " say he , point out over the moor . " do you see that over yonder ? well , do you see the low hill beyond with the upon it ? it be the stony part of the whole moor . be that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station ? your suggestion , sir , be a most absurd one . " i meekly answer that i have speak without know all the fact . my submission please him and lead him to further confidence . " you may be sure , sir , that i have very good ground before i come to an opinion . i have see the boy again and again with his bundle . every day , and sometimes twice a day , i have be wait a moment , . do my eye deceive me , or be there at the present moment something move upon that hillside ? " it be several mile off , but i could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray . " come , sir , come ! " cry , rush upstairs . " you will see with your own eye and judge for yourself . " the telescope , a formidable instrument mount upon a tripod , stand upon the flat lead of the house . clap his eye to it and give a cry of satisfaction . " quick , , quick , before he pass over the hill ! " there he be , sure enough , a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder , toil slowly up the hill . when he reach the crest i see the ragged uncouth figure outline for an instant against the cold blue sky . he look round him with a furtive and stealthy air , as one who dread pursuit . then he vanish over the hill . " well ! be i right ? " " certainly , there be a boy who seem to have some secret errand . " " and what the errand be even a county constable could guess . but not one word shall they have from me , and i bind you to secrecy also , . not a word ! you understand ! " " just as you wish . " " they have treat me . when the fact come out in v. venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country . nothing would induce me to help the police in any way . for all they care it might have be me , instead of my effigy , which these rascal burn at the stake . surely you be not go ! you will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion ! " but i resist all his solicitation and succeed in dissuade him from his announce intention of walk home with me . i keep the road as long as his eye be on me , and then i strike off across the moor and make for the stony hill over which the boy have disappear . everything be work in my favour , and i swear that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that i should miss the chance which fortune have throw in my way . the sun be already sink when i reach the summit of the hill , and the long slope beneath me be all on one side and gray shadow on the other . a haze lie low upon the farthest , out of which jut the fantastic shape of and . over the wide expanse there be no sound and no movement . one great gray bird , a gull or curlew , soar aloft in the blue heaven . he and i seem to be the only living thing between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it . the barren scene , the sense of loneliness , and the mystery and urgency of my task all strike a chill into my heart . the boy be nowhere to be see . but down beneath me in a cleft of the hill there be a circle of the old stone hut , and in the middle of them there be one which retain sufficient roof to act as a screen against the weather . my heart leap within me as i see it . this must be the burrow where the stranger lurk . at last my foot be on the threshold of his hiding secret be within my grasp . as i approach the hut , walk as warily as would do when with poise net he draw near the settle butterfly , i satisfy myself that the place have indeed be use as a habitation . a vague pathway among the boulder lead to the dilapidated opening which serve as a door . all be silent within . the unknown might be lurk there , or he might be prowl on the moor . my nerve tingle with the sense of adventure . throw aside my cigarette , i close my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walk swiftly up to the door , i look in . the place be empty . but there be ample sign that i have not come upon a false scent . this be certainly where the man live . some blanket roll in a waterproof lie upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man have once slumber . the ash of a fire be heap in a rude grate . beside it lie some cooking utensil and a bucket half-full of water . a litter of empty tin show that the place have be occupy for some time , and i see , as my eye become accustom to the checker light , a pannikin and a half-full bottle of spirit stand in the corner . in the middle of the hut a flat stone serve the purpose of a table , and upon this stand a small cloth same , no doubt , which i have see through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy . it contain a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two tin of preserve peach . as i set it down again , after have examine it , my heart leap to see that beneath it there lie a sheet of paper with write upon it . i raise it , and this be what i read , roughly scrawl in pencil : " have go to . " for a minute i stand there with the paper in my hand think out the meaning of this curt message . it be i , then , and not , who be be dog by this secret man . he have not follow me himself , but he have set an boy , my track , and this be his report . possibly i have take no step since i have be upon the moor which have not be observe and report . always there be this feeling of an unseen force , a fine net draw round us with infinite skill and delicacy , hold us so lightly that it be only at some supreme moment that one realize that one be indeed entangle in its mesh . if there be one report there might be other , so i look round the hut in search of them . there be no trace , however , of anything of the kind , nor could i discover any sign which might indicate the character or intention of the man who live in this singular place , save that he must be of spartan habit and care little for the comfort of life . when i think of the heavy rain and look at the gape roof i understand how strong and immutable must be the purpose which have keep him in that inhospitable abode . be he our malignant enemy , or be he by chance our guardian angel ? i swear that i would not leave the hut until i know . outside the sun be sink low and the west be blaze with scarlet and gold . its reflection be shoot back in ruddy patch by the distant pool which lay amid the great . there be the two tower of , and there a distant blur of smoke which mark the village of . between the two , behind the hill , be the house of the . all be sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light , and yet as i look at them my soul share none of the peace of but quiver at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant be bring near . with tingle nerve but a fix purpose , i sit in the dark recess of the hut and wait with sombre patience for the come of its tenant . and then at last i hear him . far away come the sharp clink of a boot strike upon a stone . then another and yet another , come near and near . i shrink back into the dark corner and cock the pistol in my pocket , determine not to discover myself until i have an opportunity of see something of the stranger . there be a long pause which show that he have stop . then once more the footstep approach and a shadow fall across the opening of the hut . " it be a lovely evening , my dear , " say a well-known voice . " i really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in . " for a moment or two i sit breathless , hardly able to believe my ear . then my sense and my voice come back to me , while a crush weight of responsibility seem in an instant to be lift from my soul . that cold , incisive , ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world . " ! " i ! " " come out , " say he , " and please be careful with the revolver . " i stoop under the rude lintel , and there he sit upon a stone outside , his gray eye dance with amusement as they fall upon my astonish feature . he be thin and worn , but clear and alert , his keen face bronze by the sun and roughen by the wind . in his tweed suit and cloth cap he look like any other tourist upon the moor , and he have contrive , with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which be one of his characteristic , that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he be in . " i never be more glad to see anyone in my life , " say i as i wring him by the hand . " or more astonish , ? " " well , i must confess to it . " " the surprise be not all on one side , i assure you . i have no idea that you have find my occasional retreat , still less that you be inside it , until i be within twenty pace of the door . " " my footprint , i presume ? " " no , , i fear that i could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprint of the world . if you seriously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist ; for when i see the stub of a cigarette mark , , i know that my friend be in the neighbourhood . you will see it there beside the path . you throw it down , no doubt , at that supreme moment when you charge into the empty hut . " " exactly . " " i think as know your admirable tenacity i be convince that you be sit in ambush , a weapon within reach , wait for the tenant to return . so you actually think that i be the criminal ? " " i do not know who you be , but i be determine to find out . " " excellent , ! and how do you localize me ? you see me , perhaps , on the night of the convict hunt , when i be so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me ? " " yes , i see you then . " " and have no doubt search all the hut until you come to this one ? " " no , your boy have be observe , and that give me a guide where to look . " " the old gentleman with the telescope , no doubt . i could not make it out when first i see the light flashing upon the lens . " he rise and peep into the hut . " , i see that have bring up some supply . what be this paper ? so you have be to , have you ? " " yes . " " to see ? " " exactly . " " well do ! our research have evidently be run on parallel line , and when we unite our result i expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case . " " well , i be glad from my heart that you be here , for indeed the responsibility and the mystery be both become too much for my nerve . but how in the name of wonder do you come here , and what have you be do ? i think that you be in work out that case of blackmail . " " that be what i wish you to think . " " then you use me , and yet do not trust me ! " i cry with some bitterness . " i think that i have deserve good at your hand , . " " my dear fellow , you have be invaluable to me in this as in many other case , and i beg that you will forgive me if i have seem to play a trick upon you . in truth , it be partly for your own sake that i do it , and it be my appreciation of the danger which you run which lead me to come down and examine the matter for myself . have i be with and you it be confident that my point of view would have be the same as yours , and my presence would have warn our very formidable opponent to be on their guard . as it be , i have be able to get about as i could not possibly have do have i be live in the , and i remain an unknown factor in the business , ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment . " " but why keep me in the dark ? " " for you to know could not have help us and might possibly have lead to my discovery . you would have wish to tell me something , or in your kindness you would have bring me out some comfort or other , and so an unnecessary risk would be run . i bring down with remember the little chap at the express he have see after my simple want : a loaf of bread and a clean collar . what do man want more ? he have give me an extra pair of eye upon a very active pair of foot , and both have be invaluable . " " then my report have all be waste ! " -- voice tremble as i recall the pain and the pride with which i have compose them . take a bundle of paper from his pocket . " here be your report , my dear fellow , and very well thumb , i assure you . i make excellent arrangement , and they be only delay one day upon their way . i must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have show over an extraordinarily difficult case . " i be still rather raw over the deception which have be practise upon me , but the warmth of 's praise drive my anger from my mind . i feel also in my heart that he be right in what he say and that it be really good for our purpose that i should not have know that he be upon the moor . " that be good , " say he , see the shadow rise from my face . " and now tell me the result of your visit to be not difficult for me to guess that it be to see her that you have go , for i be already aware that she be the one person in who might be of service to us in the matter . in fact , if you have not go today it be exceedingly probable that i should have go tomorrow . " the sun have set and dusk be settle over the moor . the air have turn chill and we withdraw into the hut for warmth . there , sit together in the twilight , i tell of my conversation with the lady . so interested be he that i have to repeat some of it twice before he be satisfy . " this be most important , " say he when i have conclude . " it fill up a gap which i have be unable to bridge in this most complex affair . you be aware , perhaps , that a close intimacy exist between this lady and the man ? " " i do not know of a close intimacy . " " there can be no doubt about the matter . they meet , they write , there be a complete understanding between them . now , this put a very powerful weapon into our hand . if i could only use it to detach his -- " " his wife ? " " i be give you some information now , in return for all that you have give me . the lady who have pass here as be in reality his wife . " " good heaven , ! be you sure of what you say ? how could he have permit to fall in love with her ? " " be fall in love could do no harm to anyone except . he take particular care that do not make love to her , as you have yourself observe . i repeat that the lady be his wife and not his sister . " " but why this elaborate deception ? " " because he foresee that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman . " all my unspoken instinct , my vague suspicion , suddenly take shape and centre upon the naturalist . in that impassive colourless man , with his straw hat and his , i seem to see something creature of infinite patience and craft , with a smile face and a murderous heart . " it be he , then , who be our be he who dog us in ? " " so i read the riddle . " " and the must have come from her ! " " exactly . " the shape of some monstrous villainy , half see , half guess , loom through the darkness which have gird me so long . " but be you sure of this , ? how do you know that the woman be his wife ? " " because he so far forget himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first meet you , and i dare say he have many a time regret it since . he be once a schoolmaster in the north of . now , there be no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster . there be scholastic agency by which one may identify any man who have be in the profession . a little investigation show me that a school have come to grief under atrocious circumstance , and that the man who have own name be disappear with his wife . the description agree . when i learn that the missing man be devote to entomology the identification be complete . " the darkness be rise , but much be still hide by the shadow . " if this woman be in truth his wife , where do come in ? " i ask . " that be one of the point upon which your own research have shed a light . your interview with the lady have clear the situation very much . i do not know about a project divorce between herself and her husband . in that case , regard as an unmarried man , she count no doubt upon become his wife . " " and when she be undeceive ? " " why , then we may find the lady of service . it must be our first duty to see of . do n't you think , , that you be away from your charge rather long ? your place should be at . " the last red streak have fade away in the west and night have settle upon the moor . a few faint star be gleam in a violet sky . " one last question , , " i say as i rise . " surely there be no need of secrecy between you and me . what be the meaning of it all ? what be he after ? " 's voice sink as he answer : " it be murder , , cold-blooded , deliberate murder . do not ask me for particular . my net be close upon him , even as his are upon , and with your help he be already almost at my mercy . there be but one danger which can threaten us . it be that he should strike before we be ready to do so . another at the i have my case complete , but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watch her ailing child . your mission today have justify itself , and yet i could almost wish that you have not leave his side . ! " a terrible prolong yell of horror and out of the silence of the moor . that frightful cry turn the blood to ice in my vein . " oh , my ! " i gasp . " what be it ? what do it mean ? " have spring to his foot , and i see his dark , athletic outline at the door of the hut , his shoulder stoop , his head thrust forward , his face peer into the darkness . " ! " he whisper . " ! " the cry have be loud on account of its vehemence , but it have peal out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain . now it burst upon our ear , near , loud , more urgent than before . " where be it ? " whisper ; and i know from the thrill of his voice that he , the man of iron , be shake to the soul . " where be it , ? " " there , i think . " i point into the darkness . " no , there ! " again the agonize cry sweep through the silent night , loud and much near than ever . and a new sound mingle with it , a deep , mutter rumble , musical and yet menace , rise and fall like the low , constant murmur of the sea . " the hound ! " cry . " come , , come ! great heaven , if we be too late ! " he have start run swiftly over the moor , and i have follow at his heel . but now from somewhere among the break ground immediately in front of us there come one last despair yell , and then a dull , heavy thud . we halt and listen . not another sound break the heavy silence of the windless night . i see put his hand to his forehead like a man distract . he stamp his foot upon the ground . " he have beat us , . we be too late . " " no , no , surely not ! " " fool that i be to hold my hand . and you , , see what come of abandon your charge ! but , by , if the bad have happen we will avenge him ! " blindly we run through the gloom , blunder against boulder , force our way through gorse bush , pant up hill and rush down slope , head always in the direction whence those dreadful sound have come . at every rise look eagerly round him , but the shadow be thick upon the moor , and nothing move upon its dreary face . " can you see anything ? " " nothing . " " but , hark , what be that ? " a low moan have fall upon our ear . there it be again upon our left ! on that side a ridge of rock end in a sheer cliff which overlook a slope . on its jagged face be spread-eagle some dark , irregular object . as we run towards it the vague outline harden into a definite shape . it be a prostrate man face downward upon the ground , the head double under him at a horrible angle , the shoulder round and the body hunch together as if in the act of throw a somersault . so grotesque be the attitude that i could not for the instant realize that that moan have be the passing of his soul . not a whisper , not a rustle , rise now from the dark figure over which we stoop . lay his hand upon him and hold it up again with an exclamation of horror . the gleam of the match which he strike shine upon his clot finger and upon the ghastly pool which widen slowly from the crushed skull of the victim . and it shine upon something else which turn our heart sick and faint within body of ! there be no chance of either of us forget that peculiar ruddy tweed very one which he have wear on the first morning that we have see him in . we catch the one clear glimpse of it , and then the match flicker and go out , even as the hope have go out of our soul . groan , and his face glimmer white through the darkness . " the brute ! the brute ! " i cry with clench hand . " oh , i shall never forgive myself for have leave him to his fate . " " i be more to blame than you , . in order to have my case well rounded and complete , i have throw away the life of my client . it be the great blow which have befall me in my career . but how could i could i he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warning ? " " that we should have hear his , those scream ! -- yet have be unable to save him ! where be this brute of a hound which drive him to his death ? it may be lurk among these rock at this instant . and , where be he ? he shall answer for this deed . " " he shall . i will see to that . uncle and nephew have be one frighten to death by the very sight of a beast which he think to be supernatural , the other drive to his end in his wild flight to escape from it . but now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast . save from what we hear , we can even swear to the existence of the latter , since have evidently die from the fall . but , by heaven , cunning as he be , the fellow shall be in my power before another day be past ! " we stand with bitter heart on either side of the mangle body , overwhelm by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which have bring all our long and weary labour to so piteous an end . then as the moon rise we climb to the top of the rock over which our poor friend have fall , and from the summit we gaze out over the shadowy moor , half silver and half gloom . far away , mile off , in the direction of , a single steady yellow light be shine . it could only come from the lonely abode of the . with a bitter curse i shake my fist at it as i gaze . " why should we not seize him at once ? " " our case be not complete . the fellow be wary and cunning to the last degree . it be not what we know , but what we can prove . if we make one false move the villain may escape us yet . " " what can we do ? " " there will be plenty for us to do tomorrow . tonight we can only perform the last office to our poor friend . " together we make our way down the precipitous slope and approach the body , black and clear against the silver stone . the agony of those contorted limb strike me with a spasm of pain and blur my eye with tear . " we must send for help , ! we can carry him all the way to the . good heaven , be you mad ? " he have utter a cry and bent over the body . now he be dance and laugh and wring my hand . could this be my stern , self-contained friend ? these be hidden fire , indeed ! " a beard ! a beard ! the man have a beard ! " " a beard ? " " it be not the , it be my neighbour , the convict ! " with feverish haste we have turn the body over , and that drip beard be point up to the cold , clear moon . there could be no doubt about the beetle forehead , the sunken animal eye . it be indeed the same face which have glare upon me in the light of the candle from over the face of , the criminal . then in an instant it be all clear to me . i remember how the baronet have tell me that he have hand his old wardrobe to . have pass it on in order to help in his escape . , shirt , be all 's . the tragedy be still black enough , but this man have at least deserve death by the law of his country . i tell how the matter stand , my heart bubble over with thankfulness and joy . " then the clothes have be the poor devil 's death , " say he . " it be clear enough that the hound have be lay on from some article of boot which be abstract in the hotel , in all so run this man down . there be one very singular thing , however : how come , in the darkness , to know that the hound be on his trail ? " " he hear him . " " to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by scream wildly for help . by his cry he must have run a long way after he know the animal be on his track . how do he know ? " " a great mystery to me be why this hound , presume that all our conjecture be -- " " i presume nothing . " " well , then , why this hound should be loose tonight . i suppose that it do not always run loose upon the moor . would not let it go unless he have reason to think that would be there . " " my difficulty be the more formidable of the two , for i think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours , while mine may remain forever a mystery . the question now be , what shall we do with this poor wretch 's body ? we can leave it here to the fox and the raven . " " i suggest that we put it in one of the hut until we can communicate with the police . " " exactly . i have no doubt that you and i could carry it so far . halloa , , what be this ? it be the man himself , by all that be wonderful and audacious ! not a word to show your a word , or my plan crumble to the ground . " a figure be approach us over the moor , and i see the dull red glow of a cigar . the moon shine upon him , and i could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist . he stop when he see us , and then come on again . " why , , that be not you , be it ? you be the last man that i should have expect to see out on the moor at this time of night . but , dear me , what be this ? somebody hurt ? n't tell me that it be our friend ! " he hurry past me and stoop over the dead man . i hear a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fall from his finger . " 's this ? " he stammer . " it be , the man who escape from . " turn a ghastly face upon us , but by a supreme effort he have overcome his amazement and his disappointment . he look sharply from to me . " dear me ! what a very shocking affair ! how do he die ? " " he appear to have break his neck by fall over these rock . my friend and i be stroll on the moor when we hear a cry . " " i hear a cry also . that be what bring me out . i be uneasy about . " " why about in particular ? " i could not help ask . " because i have suggest that he should come over . when he do not come i be surprise , and i naturally become alarm for his safety when i hear cry upon the moor . by the eye dart again from my face to you hear anything else besides a cry ? " " no , " say ; " do you ? " " no. " " what do you mean , then ? " " oh , you know the storey that the peasant tell about a phantom hound , and so on . it be say to be hear at night upon the moor . i be wonder if there be any evidence of such a sound tonight . " " we hear nothing of the kind , " say " and what be your theory of this poor fellow 's death ? " " i have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have drive him off his head . he have rush about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fall over here and break his neck . " " that seem the most reasonable theory , " say , and he give a sigh which i take to indicate his relief . " what do you think about it , ? " my friend bow his compliment . " you be quick at identification , " say he . " we have be expect you in these part since come down . you be in time to see a tragedy . " " yes , indeed . i have no doubt that my friend 's explanation will cover the fact . i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to with me tomorrow . " " oh , you return tomorrow ? " " that be my intention . " " i hope your visit have cast some light upon those occurrence which have puzzle us ? " shrug his shoulder . " one can always have the success for which one hope . an investigator need fact and not legend or rumour . it have not be a satisfactory case . " my friend speak in his frank and most unconcerned manner . still look hard at him . then he turn to me . " i would suggest carry this poor fellow to my house , but it would give my sister such a fright that i do not feel justified in do it . i think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning . " and so it be arrange . resist 's offer of hospitality , and i set off to , leave the naturalist to return alone . look back we see the figure move slowly away over the broad moor , and behind him that one black smudge on the silver slope which show where the man be lie who have come so horribly to his end . " we be at close grip at last , " say as we walk together across the moor . " what a nerve the fellow have ! how he pull himself together in the face of what must have be a paralyze shock when he find that the wrong man have fall a victim to his plot . i tell you in , , and i tell you now again , that we have never have a foeman more worthy of our steel . " " i be sorry that he have see you . " " and so be i at first . but there be no get out of it . " " what effect do you think it will have upon his plan now that he know you be here ? " " it may cause him to be more cautious , or it may drive him to desperate measure at once . like most clever criminal , he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he have completely deceive us . " " why should we not arrest him at once ? " " my dear , you be bear to be a man of action . your instinct be always to do something energetic . but suppose , for argument 's sake , that we have him arrest tonight , what on earth the well off should we be for that ? we could prove nothing against him . there be the devilish cunning of it ! if he be act through a human agent we could get some evidence , but if we be to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help us in put a rope round the neck of its master . " " surely we have a case . " " not a shadow of surmise and conjecture . we should be laugh out of court if we come with such a story and such evidence . " " there be 's death . " " find dead without a mark upon him . you and i know that he die of sheer fright , and we know also what frighten him , but how be we to get twelve stolid juryman to know it ? what sign be there of a hound ? where be the mark of its fang ? of course we know that a hound do not bite a dead body and that be dead before ever the brute overtake him . but we have to prove all this , and we be not in a position to do it . " " well , then , tonight ? " " we be not much good off tonight . again , there be no direct connection between the hound and the man 's death . we never see the hound . we hear it , but we could not prove that it be run upon this man 's trail . there be a complete absence of motive . no , my dear fellow ; we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present , and that it be worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one . " " and how do you propose to do so ? " " i have great hope of what may do for us when the position of affair be make clear to her . and i have my own plan as well . sufficient for tomorrow be the evil thereof ; but i hope before the day be past to have the upper hand at last . " i could draw nothing further from him , and he walk , lose in thought , as far as the gate . " be you come up ? " " yes ; i see no reason for further concealment . but one last word , . say nothing of the hound to . let him think that 's death be as would have us believe . he will have a good nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow , when he be engage , if i remember your report aright , to dine with these people . " " and so be " " then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone . that will be easily arrange . and now , if we be too late for dinner , i think that we be both ready for our supper . " be more please than surprise to see , for he have for some day be expect that recent event would bring him down from . he do raise his eyebrow , however , when he find that my friend have neither any luggage nor any explanation for its absence . between us we soon supply his want , and then over a belated supper we explain to the baronet as much of our experience as it seem desirable that he should know . but first i have the unpleasant duty of break the news to and his wife . to him it may have be an unmitigated relief , but she weep bitterly in her apron . to all the world he be the man of violence , half animal and half demon ; but to her he always remain the little wilful boy of her own girlhood , the child who have cling to her hand . evil indeed be the man who have not one woman to mourn him . " i have be mope in the house all day since go off in the morning , " say the baronet . " i guess i should have some credit , for i have keep my promise . if i have n't swear not to go about alone i might have have a more lively evening , for i have a message from ask me over there . " " i have no doubt that you would have have a more lively evening , " say drily . " by the way , i do n't suppose you appreciate that we have be mourn over you as have break your neck ? " open his eye . " how be that ? " " this poor wretch be dress in your clothes . i fear your servant who give them to him may get into trouble with the police . " " that be unlikely . there be no mark on any of them , as far as i know . " " that be lucky for fact , it be lucky for all of you , since you be all on the wrong side of the law in this matter . i be not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty be not to arrest the whole household . 's report be most incriminate document . " " but how about the case ? " ask the baronet . " have you make anything out of the tangle ? i do n't know that and i be much the wise since we come down . " " i think that i shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long . it have be an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business . there be several point upon which we still want it be come all the same . " " we have have one experience , as have no doubt tell you . we hear the hound on the moor , so i can swear that it be not all empty superstition . i have something to do with dog when i be out west , and i know one when i hear one . if you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain i will be ready to swear you be the great detective of all time . " " i think i will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help . " " whatever you tell me to do i will do . " " very good ; and i will ask you also to do it blindly , without always ask the reason . " " just as you like . " " if you will do this i think the chance be that our little problem will soon be solve . i have no -- " he stop suddenly and stare fixedly up over my head into the air . the lamp beat upon his face , and so intent be it and so still that it might have be that of a clear-cut classical statue , a personification of alertness and expectation . " what be it ? " we both cry . i could see as he look down that he be repress some internal emotion . his feature be still compose , but his eye shine with amused exultation . " excuse the admiration of a connoisseur , " say he as he wave his hand towards the line of portrait which cover the opposite wall . " wo n't allow that i know anything of art but that be mere jealousy because our view upon the subject differ . now , these be a really very fine series of portrait . " " well , i be glad to hear you say so , " say , glance with some surprise at my friend . " i do n't pretend to know much about these thing , and i will be a good judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture . i do n't know that you find time for such thing . " " i know what be good when i see it , and i see it now . that be a , i will swear , that lady in the blue silk over yonder , and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a . they be all family portrait , i presume ? " " every one . " " do you know the name ? " " have be coach me in them , and i think i can say my lesson fairly well . " " who be the gentleman with the telescope ? " " that be , who serve under in the . the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper be , who be of committee of the of under . " " and this opposite to one with the black velvet and the lace ? " " ah , you have a right to know about him . that be the cause of all the mischief , the wicked , who start the hound of the . we be not likely to forget him . " i gaze with interest and some surprise upon the portrait . " dear me ! " say , " he seem a quiet , man enough , but i dare say that there be a lurk devil in his eye . i have picture him as a more robust and ruffianly person . " " there be no doubt about the authenticity , for the name and the date , @card@ , be on the back of the canvas . " say little more , but the picture of the old seem to have a fascination for him , and his eye be continually fix upon it during supper . it be not until later , when have go to his room , that i be able to follow the trend of his thought . he lead me back into the , his bedroom candle in his hand , and he hold it up against the portrait on the wall . " do you see anything there ? " i look at the broad plume hat , the curling , the white lace collar , and the straight , severe face which be frame between them . it be not a brutal countenance , but it be prim , hard , and stern , with a , mouth , and a coldly intolerant eye . " be it like anyone you know ? " " there be something of about the jaw . " " just a suggestion , perhaps . but wait an instant ! " he stand upon a chair , and , hold up the light in his left hand , he curve his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlet . " good heaven ! " i cry in amazement . the face of have spring out of the canvas . " , you see it now . my eye have be train to examine face and not their trimming . it be the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise . " " but this be marvellous . it might be his portrait . " " yes , it be an interesting instance of a throwback , which appear to be both physical and spiritual . a study of family portrait be enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation . the fellow be a be evident . " " with design upon the succession . " " exactly . this chance of the picture have supply us with one of our most obvious missing link . we have him , , we have him , and i dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be flutter in our net as helpless as one of his own butterfly . a pin , a cork , and a card , and we add him to the collection ! " he burst into one of his rare fit of laughter as he turn away from the picture . i have not hear him laugh often , and it have always bode ill to somebody . i be up betimes in the morning , but be afoot earlier still , for i see him as i dress , come up the drive . " yes , we should have a full day today , " he remark , and he rub his hand with the joy of action . " the net be all in place , and the drag be about to begin . we will know before the day be out whether we have catch our big , pike , or whether he have get through the mesh . " " have you be on the moor already ? " " i have send a report from to as to the death of . i think i can promise that none of you will be trouble in the matter . and i have also communicate with my faithful , who would certainly have pine away at the door of my hut , as a dog do at his master 's grave , if i have not set his mind at rest about my safety . " " what be the next move ? " " to see . ah , here he be ! " " , , " say the baronet . " you look like a general who be plan a battle with his chief of the staff . " " that be the exact situation . be ask for order . " " and so do " " very good . you be engage , as i understand , to dine with our friend the tonight . " " i hope that you will come also . they be very hospitable people , and i be sure that they would be very glad to see you . " " i fear that and i must go to . " " to ? " " yes , i think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture . " the baronet 's face perceptibly lengthen . " i hope that you be go to see me through this business . the and the moor be not very pleasant place when one be alone . " " my dear fellow , you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what i tell you . you can tell your friend that we should have be happy to have come with you , but that urgent business require us to be in town . we hope very soon to return to . will you remember to give them that message ? " " if you insist upon it . " " there be no alternative , i assure you . " i see by the baronet 's clouded brow that he be deeply hurt by what he regard as our desertion . " when do you desire to go ? " he ask coldly . " immediately after breakfast . we will drive in to , but will leave his thing as a pledge that he will come back to you . , you will send a note to to tell him that you regret that you can come . " " i have a good mind to go to with you , " say the baronet . " why should i stay here alone ? " " because it be your post of duty . because you give me your word that you would do as you be tell , and i tell you to stay . " " all right , then , i will stay . " " one more direction ! i wish you to drive to . send back your trap , however , and let them know that you intend to walk home . " " to walk across the moor ? " " yes . " " but that be the very thing which you have so often caution me not to do . " " this time you may do it with safety . if i have not every confidence in your nerve and courage i would not suggest it , but it be essential that you should do it . " " then i will do it . " " and as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which lead from to the , and be your natural way home . " " i will do just what you say . " " very good . i should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible , so as to reach in the afternoon . " i be much astound by this programme , though i remember that have say to on the night before that his visit would terminate next day . it have not cross my mind however , that he would wish me to go with him , nor could i understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declare to be critical . there be nothing for it , however , but implicit obedience ; so we bid good-bye to our rueful friend , and a couple of hour afterwards we be at the station of and have dispatch the trap upon its return journey . a small boy be wait upon the platform . " any order , sir ? " " you will take this train to town , . the moment you arrive you will send a wire to , in my name , to say that if he find the pocketbook which i have drop he be to send it by registered post to . " " yes , sir . " " and ask at the station office if there be a message for me . " the boy return with a telegram , which hand to me . it run : wire receive . come down with unsigned warrant . arrive . . " that be in answer to mine of this morning . he be the good of the professional , i think , and we may need his assistance . now , , i think that we can employ our time well than by call upon your acquaintance , . " his plan of campaign be begin to be evident . he would use the baronet in order to convince the that we be really go , while we should actually return at the instant when we be likely to be need . that telegram from , if mention by to the , must remove the last suspicion from their mind . already i seem to see our net draw close around that pike . be in her office , and open his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amaze her . " i be investigate the circumstance which attend the death of the late , " say he . " my friend here , , have inform me of what you have communicate , and also of what you have withhold in connection with that matter . " " what have i withhold ? " she ask defiantly . " you have confess that you ask to be at the gate at ten o'clock . we know that that be the place and hour of his death . you have withhold what the connection be between these event . " " there be no connection . " " in that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one . but i think that we shall succeed in establish a connection , after all . i wish to be perfectly frank with you , . we regard this case as one of murder , and the evidence may implicate not only your friend but his wife as well . " the lady spring from her chair . " his wife ! " she cry . " the fact be no longer a secret . the person who have pass for his sister be really his wife . " have resume her seat . her hand be grasp the arm of her chair , and i see that the pink nail have turn white with the pressure of her grip . " his wife ! " she say again . " his wife ! he be not a married man . " shrug his shoulder . " prove it to me ! prove it to me ! and if you can do -- ! " the fierce flash of her eye say more than any word . " i have come prepare to do so , " say , draw several paper from his pocket . " here be a photograph of the couple take in four year ago . it be indorse ' and , ' but you will have no difficulty in recognize him , and her also , if you know her by sight . here be three written description by trustworthy witness of and , who at that time keep 's private school . read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people . " she glance at them , and then look up at us with the set , rigid face of a desperate woman . " , " she say , " this man have offer me marriage on condition that i could get a divorce from my husband . he have lie to me , the villain , in every conceivable way . not one word of truth have he ever tell me . and ? i imagine that all be for my own sake . but now i see that i be never anything but a tool in his hand . why should i preserve faith with him who never keep any with me ? why should i try to shield him from the consequence of his own wicked act ? ask me what you like , and there be nothing which i shall hold back . one thing i swear to you , and that be that when i write the letter i never dream of any harm to the old gentleman , who have be my kind friend . " " i entirely believe you , madam , " say . " the recital of these event must be very painful to you , and perhaps it will make it easy if i tell you what occur , and you can check me if i make any material mistake . the send of this letter be suggest to you by ? " " he dictate it . " " i presume that the reason he give be that you would receive help from for the legal expense connect with your divorce ? " " exactly . " " and then after you have send the letter he dissuade you from keep the appointment ? " " he tell me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other man should find the money for such an object , and that though he be a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to remove the obstacle which divide us . " " he appear to be a very consistent character . and then you hear nothing until you read the report of the death in the paper ? " " no. " " and he make you swear to say nothing about your appointment with ? " " he do . he say that the death be a very mysterious one , and that i should certainly be suspect if the fact come out . he frighten me into remain silent . " " quite so . but you have your suspicion ? " she hesitate and look down . " i know him , " she say . " but if he have keep faith with me i should always have do so with him . " " i think that on the whole you have have a fortunate escape , " say . " you have have him in your power and he know it , and yet you be alive . you have be walk for some month very near to the edge of a precipice . we must wish you now , , and it be probable that you will very shortly hear from us again . " " our case become round off , and difficulty after difficulty thin away in front of us , " say as we stand wait for the arrival of the express from town . " i shall soon be in the position of be able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crime of modern time . student of criminology will remember the analogous incident in , in , in the year ' @card@ , and of course there be the murder in , but this case possess some feature which be entirely its own . even now we have no clear case against this very wily man . but i shall be very much surprise if it be not clear enough before we go to bed this night . " the express come roar into the station , and a small , wiry bulldog of a man have spring from a first-class carriage . we all three shook hand , and i see at once from the reverential way in which gaze at my companion that he have learn a good deal since the day when they have first work together . i could well remember the scorn which the theory of the use then to excite in the practical man . " anything good ? " he ask . " the big thing for year , " say . " we have two hour before we need think of start . i think we might employ it in get some dinner and then , , we will take the fog out of your throat by give you a breath of the pure night air of . never be there ? ah , well , i do n't suppose you will forget your first visit . " one of 's , indeed , one may call it a that he be exceedingly loath to communicate his full plan to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment . partly it come no doubt from his own masterful nature , which love to dominate and surprise those who be around him . partly also from his professional caution , which urge him never to take any chance . the result , however , be very try for those who be act as his agent and assistant . i have often suffer under it , but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness . the great ordeal be in front of us ; at last we be about to make our final effort , and yet have say nothing , and i could only surmise what his course of action would be . my nerve thrill with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our face and the dark , void space on either side of the narrow road tell me that we be back upon the moor once again . every stride of the horse and every turn of the wheel be take us near to our supreme adventure . our conversation be hamper by the presence of the driver of the hire wagonette , so that we be force to talk of trivial matter when our nerve be tense with emotion and anticipation . it be a relief to me , after that unnatural restraint , when we at last pass 's house and know that we be draw near to the and to the scene of action . we do not drive up to the door but get down near the gate of the avenue . the wagonette be pay off and order to return to forthwith , while we start to walk to . " be you arm , ? " the little detective smile . " as long as i have my trouser i have a hip-pocket , and as long as i have my hip-pocket i have something in it . " " good ! my friend and i be also ready for emergency . " " you be mighty close about this affair , . what be the game now ? " " a wait game . " " my word , it do not seem a very cheerful place , " say the detective with a shiver , glance round him at the gloomy slope of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lie over the . " i see the light of a house ahead of us . " " that be and the end of our journey . i must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper . " we move cautiously along the track as if we be bind for the house , but halt us when we be about two hundred yard from it . " this will do , " say he . " these rock upon the right make an admirable screen . " " we be to wait here ? " " yes , we shall make our little ambush here . get into this hollow , . you have be inside the house , have you not , ? can you tell the position of the room ? what be those latticed window at this end ? " " i think they be the kitchen window . " " and the one beyond , which shine so brightly ? " " that be certainly the dining-room . " " the blind be up . you know the lie of the land well . creep forward quietly and see what they be for heaven 's sake do n't let them know that they be watch ! " i tiptoe down the path and stoop behind the low wall which surround the stunted orchard . creep in its shadow i reach a point whence i could look straight through the window . there be only two man in the room , and . they sit with their profile towards me on either side of the round table . both of them be smoke cigar , and coffee and wine be in front of them . be talk with animation , but the baronet look pale and distrait . perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor be weigh heavily upon his mind . as i watch them rise and leave the room , while fill his glass again and lean back in his chair , puff at his cigar . i hear the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boot upon gravel . the step pass along the path on the other side of the wall under which i crouch . look over , i see the naturalist pause at the door of an in the corner of the orchard . a key turn in a lock , and as he pass in there be a curious scuffle noise from within . he be only a minute or so inside , and then i hear the key turn once more and he pass me and reenter the house . i see him rejoin his guest , and i creep quietly back to where my companion be wait to tell them what i have see . " you say , , that the lady be not there ? " ask when i have finish my report . " no. " " where can she be , then , since there be no light in any other room except the kitchen ? " " i can think where she be . " i have say that over the great there hang a dense , white fog . it be drift slowly in our direction and bank itself up like a wall on that side of us , low but thick and well define . the moon shine on it , and it look like a great shimmer , with the head of the distant tor as rock bear upon its surface . 's face be turn towards it , and he mutter impatiently as he watch its sluggish drift . " it be move towards us , . " " be that serious ? " " very serious , one thing upon earth which could have disarrange my plan . he ca n't be very long , now . it be already ten o'clock . our success and even his life may depend upon his come out before the fog be over the path . " the night be clear and fine above us . the star shine cold and bright , while a half-moon bath the whole scene in a soft , uncertain light . before us lie the dark bulk of the house , its serrated roof and bristle chimney hard outline against the sky . broad bar of golden light from the low window stretch across the orchard and the moor . one of them be suddenly shut off . the servant have leave the kitchen . there only remain the lamp in the dining-room where the two man , the murderous host and the unconscious guest , still chat over their cigar . every minute that white woolly plain which cover one-half of the moor be drift closer and closer to the house . already the first thin wisp of it be curl across the golden square of the lighted window . the farther wall of the orchard be already invisible , and the tree be stand out of a swirl of white vapour . as we watch it the come crawl round both corner of the house and roll slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof float like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea . strike his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamp his foot in his impatience . " if he be n't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be cover . in half an hour we wo n't be able to see our hand in front of us . " " shall we move farther back upon high ground ? " " yes , i think it would be as well . " so as the flow onward we fall back before it until we be half a mile from the house , and still that dense white sea , with the moon silver its upper edge , sweep slowly and inexorably on . " we be go too far , " say . " we dare not take the chance of his be overtake before he can reach us . at all cost we must hold our ground where we be . " he drop on his knee and clap his ear to the ground . " thank , i think that i hear him come . " a sound of quick step break the silence of the moor . crouch among the stone we stare intently at the bank in front of us . the step grow louder , and through the fog , as through a curtain , there step the man whom we be await . he look round him in surprise as he emerge into the clear , starlit night . then he come swiftly along the path , pass close to where we lie , and go on up the long slope behind us . as he walk he glance continually over either shoulder , like a man who be ill at ease . " ! " cry , and i hear the sharp click of a cock pistol . " look out ! it be come ! " there be a thin , crisp , continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawl bank . the cloud be within fifty yard of where we lie , and we glare at it , all three , uncertain what horror be about to break from the heart of it . i be at 's elbow , and i glance for an instant at his face . it be pale and exultant , his eye shine brightly in the moonlight . but suddenly they start forward in a rigid , fix stare , and his lip part in amazement . at the same instant give a yell of terror and throw himself face downward upon the ground . i spring to my foot , my inert hand grasp my pistol , my mind paralyze by the dreadful shape which have spring out upon us from the shadow of the fog . a hound it be , an enormous hound , but not such a hound as mortal eye have ever see . fire burst from its open mouth , its eye glow with a smoulder glare , its muzzle and hackle and dewlap be outline in flicker flame . never in the delirious dream of a disorder brain could anything more savage , more appalling , more hellish be conceive than that dark form and savage face which break upon us out of the wall of fog . with long bound the huge black creature be leap down the track , follow hard upon the footstep of our friend . so paralyze be we by the apparition that we allow him to pass before we have recover our nerve . then and i both fire together , and the creature give a hideous howl , which show that one at least have hit him . he do not pause , however , but bound onward . far away on the path we see look back , his face white in the moonlight , his hand raise in horror , glare helplessly at the frightful thing which be hunt him down . but that cry of pain from the hound have blow all our fear to the wind . if he be vulnerable he be mortal , and if we could wound him we could kill him . never have i see a man run as run that night . i be reckon fleet of foot , but he outpaced me as much as i outpace the little professional . in front of us as we fly up the track we hear scream after scream from and the deep roar of the hound . i be in time to see the beast spring upon its victim , hurl him to the ground , and worry at his throat . but the next instant have empty five barrel of his revolver into the creature 's flank . with a last howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air , it roll upon its back , four foot paw furiously , and then fall limp upon its side . i stoop , pant , and press my pistol to the dreadful , shimmer head , but it be useless to press the trigger . the giant hound be dead . lie insensible where he have fall . we tear away his collar , and breathe a prayer of gratitude when we see that there be no sign of a wound and that the rescue have be in time . already our friend 's eyelid shiver and he make a feeble effort to move . thrust his between the baronet 's tooth , and two frightened eye be look up at us . " ! " he whisper . " what be it ? what , in heaven 's name , be it ? " " it be dead , whatever it be , " say . " we have lay the family ghost once and forever . " in mere size and strength it be a terrible creature which be lie stretched before us . it be not a pure bloodhound and it be not a pure mastiff ; but it appear to be a combination of the , savage , and as large as a small lioness . even now in the stillness of death , the huge jaw seem to be drip with a bluish flame and the small , deep-set , cruel eye be ringed with fire . i place my hand upon the glowing muzzle , and as i hold them up my own finger smoulder and gleam in the darkness . " phosphorus , " i say . " a cunning preparation of it , " say , sniff at the dead animal . " there be no smell which might have interfere with his power of scent . we owe you a deep apology , , for have expose you to this fright . i be prepare for a hound , but not for such a creature as this . and the fog give us little time to receive him . " " you have save my life . " " have first endanger it . be you strong enough to stand ? " " give me another mouthful of that brandy and i shall be ready for anything . so ! now , if you will help me up . what do you propose to do ? " " to leave you here . you be not fit for further adventure tonight . if you will wait , one or other of us will go back with you to the . " he try to stagger to his foot ; but he be still ghastly pale and tremble in every limb . we help him to a rock , where he sit shiver with his face bury in his hand . " we must leave you now , " say . " the rest of our work must be do , and every moment be of importance . we have our case , and now we only want our man . " it be a thousand to one against our find him at the house , " he continue as we retrace our step swiftly down the path . " those shot must have tell him that the game be up . " " we be some distance off , and this fog may have deaden them . " " he follow the hound to call him that you may be certain . no , no , he be go by this time ! but we will search the house and make sure . " the front door be open , so we rush in and hurry from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant , who meet us in the passage . there be no light save in the dining-room , but catch up the lamp and leave no corner of the house unexplored . no sign could we see of the man whom we be chase . on the upper floor , however , one of the bedroom door be lock . " there be someone in here , " cry . " i can hear a movement . open this door ! " a faint moan and rustle come from within . strike the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it fly open . pistol in hand , we all three rush into the room . but there be no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expect to see . instead we be face by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stand for a moment stare at it in amazement . the room have be fashion into a small museum , and the wall be line by a number of glass-topped case full of that collection of butterfly and moth the formation of which have be the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man . in the centre of this room there be an upright beam , which have be place at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk of timber which span the roof . to this post a figure be tie , so swathe and muffle in the sheet which have be use to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it be that of a man or a woman . one towel pass round the throat and be secure at the back of the pillar . another cover the low part of the face , and over it two dark full of grief and shame and a dreadful back at us . in a minute we have tear off the gag , the bond , and sink upon the floor in front of us . as her beautiful head fall upon her chest i see the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck . " the brute ! " cry . " here , , your ! put her in the chair ! she have faint from ill-usage and exhaustion . " she open her eye again . " be he safe ? " she ask . " have he escape ? " " he can escape us , madam . " " no , no , i do not mean my husband . ? be he safe ? " " yes . " " and the hound ? " " it be dead . " she give a long sigh of satisfaction . " thank ! thank ! oh , this villain ! see how he have treat me ! " she shoot her arm out from her sleeve , and we see with horror that they be all mottle with bruise . " but this be ! it be my mind and soul that he have torture and defile . i could endure it all , ill-usage , solitude , a life of deception , everything , as long as i could still cling to the hope that i have his love , but now i know that in this also i have be his dupe and his tool . " she break into passionate sob as she speak . " you bear him no good will , madam , " say . " tell us then where we shall find him . if you have ever aid him in evil , help us now and so atone . " " there be but one place where he can have flee , " she answer . " there be an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire . it be there that he keep his hound and there also he have make preparation so that he might have a refuge . that be where he would fly . " the lie like white wool against the window . hold the lamp towards it . " see , " say he . " no one could find his way into the tonight . " she laugh and clap her hand . her eye and tooth gleam with fierce merriment . " he may find his way in , but never out , " she cry . " how can he see the guiding wand tonight ? we plant them together , he and i , to mark the pathway through the mire . oh , if i could only have pluck them out today . then indeed you would have have him at your mercy ! " it be evident to us that all pursuit be in vain until the fog have lift . meanwhile we leave in possession of the house while and i go back with the baronet to . the story of the could no longer be withhold from him , but he take the blow bravely when he learn the truth about the woman whom he have love . but the shock of the night 's adventure have shatter his nerve , and before morning he lie delirious in a high fever under the care of . the two of them be destine to travel together round the world before have become once more the hale , hearty man that he have be before he become master of that ill-omened estate . and now i come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative , in which i have try to make the reader share those dark fear and vague surmise which cloud our life so long and end in so tragic a manner . on the morning after the death of the hound the fog have lift and we be guide by to the point where they have find a pathway through the bog . it help us to realize the horror of this woman 's life when we see the eagerness and joy with which she lay us on her husband 's track . we leave her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm , peaty soil which taper out into the widespread bog . from the end of it a small wand plant here and there show where the path zigzag from tuft to tuft of rush among those pit and foul quagmire which bar the way to the stranger . rank reed and lush , slimy send an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our face , while a false step plunge us more than once into the dark , quiver mire , which shake for yard in soft undulation around our foot . its tenacious grip pluck at our heel as we walk , and when we sink into it it be as if some malignant hand be tug us down into those obscene depth , so grim and purposeful be the clutch in which it hold us . once only we see a trace that someone have pass that perilous way before us . from amid a tuft of cotton grass which bear it up out of the slime some dark thing be project . sink to his waist as he step from the path to seize it , and have we not be there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again . he hold an old black boot in the air . " , , " be print on the leather inside . " it be worth a mud bath , " say he . " it be our friend 's missing boot . " " throw there by in his flight . " " exactly . he retain it in his hand after use it to set the hound upon the track . he flee when he know the game be up , still clutch it . and he hurl it away at this point of his flight . we know at least that he come so far in safety . " but more than that we be never destine to know , though there be much which we might surmise . there be no chance of find footstep in the mire , for the rise mud ooze swiftly in upon them , but as we at last reach firm ground beyond the morass we all look eagerly for them . but no slight sign of them ever meet our eye . if the earth tell a true story , then never reach that island of refuge towards which he struggle through the fog upon that last night . somewhere in the heart of the great , down in the foul slime of the huge morass which have suck him in , this cold and man be forever bury . many trace we find of him in the island where he have hide his savage ally . a huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish show the position of an abandon mine . beside it be the crumble remain of the cottage of the miner , drive away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp . in one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnaw bone show where the animal have be confine . a skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhere to it lie among the debris . " a dog ! " say . " by , a curly-haired spaniel . will never see his pet again . well , i do not know that this place contain any secret which we have not already fathom . he could hide his hound , but he could not hush its voice , and hence come those cry which even in daylight be not pleasant to hear . on an emergency he could keep the hound in the at , but it be always a risk , and it be only on the supreme day , which he regard as the end of all his effort , that he dare do it . this paste in the tin be no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature be daub . it be suggest , of course , by the story of the family , and by the desire to frighten old to death . no wonder the poor devil of a convict run and scream , even as our friend do , and as we ourselves might have do , when he see such a creature bound through the darkness of the moor upon his track . it be a cunning device , for , apart from the chance of drive your victim to his death , what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it , as many have do , upon the moor ? i say it in , , and i say it again now , that never yet have we help to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who be lie sweep his long arm towards the huge mottle expanse of bog which stretch away until it merge into the russet slope of the moor . it be the end of , and and i sit , upon a raw and foggy night , on either side of a blaze fire in our sitting-room in . since the tragic upshot of our visit to he have be engage in two affair of the utmost importance , in the first of which he have expose the atrocious conduct of in connection with the famous card scandal of the , while in the second he have defend the unfortunate mme . from the charge of murder which hang over her in connection with the death of her , mlle . , the young lady who , as it will be remember , be find six month later alive and marry in . my friend be in excellent spirit over the success which have attend a succession of difficult and important case , so that i be able to induce him to discuss the detail of the mystery . i have wait patiently for the opportunity for i be aware that he would never permit case to overlap , and that his clear and logical mind would not be draw from its present work to dwell upon memory of the past . and be , however , in , on their way to that long voyage which have be recommend for the restoration of his shattered nerve . they have call upon us that very afternoon , so that it be natural that the subject should come up for discussion . " the whole course of event , " say , " from the point of view of the man who call himself be simple and direct , although to us , who have no means in the beginning of know the motive of his action and could only learn part of the fact , it all appear exceedingly complex . i have have the advantage of two conversation with , and the case have now be so entirely clear up that i be not aware that there be anything which have remain a secret to us . you will find a few note upon the matter under the head b in my index list of case . " " perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of event from memory . " " certainly , though i can guarantee that i carry all the fact in my mind . intense mental concentration have a curious way of blot out what have pass . the barrister who have his case at his finger ' end and be able to argue with an expert upon his own subject find that a week or two of the court will drive it all out of his head once more . so each of my case displace the last , and mlle . have blur my recollection of . tomorrow some other little problem may be submit to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair french lady and the infamous . so far as the case of the hound go , however , i will give you the course of event as nearly as i can , and you will suggest anything which i may have forget . " my inquiry show beyond all question that the family portrait do not lie , and that this fellow be indeed a . he be a son of that , the young brother of , who flee with a sinister reputation to , where he be say to have die unmarried . he do , as a matter of fact , marry , and have one child , this fellow , whose real name be the same as his father 's . he marry , one of the beauty of , and , have purloin a considerable sum of public money , he change his name to and flee to , where he establish a school in the east of . his reason for attempt this special line of business be that he have strike up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home , and that he have use this man 's ability to make the undertaking a success . , the tutor , die however , and the school which have begin well sink from disrepute into infamy . the find it convenient to change their name to , and he bring the remain of his fortune , his scheme for the future , and his taste for entomology to the south of . i learn at the british that he be a recognize authority upon the subject , and that the name of have be permanently attach to a certain moth which he have , in his day , be the first to describe . " we now come to that portion of his life which have prove to be of such intense interest to us . the fellow have evidently make inquiry and find that only two life intervene between him and a valuable estate . when he go to his plan be , i believe , exceedingly hazy , but that he mean mischief from the first be evident from the way in which he take his wife with him in the character of his sister . the idea of use her as a decoy be clearly already in his mind , though he may not have be certain how the detail of his plot be to be arrange . he mean in the end to have the estate , and he be ready to use any tool or run any risk for that end . his first act be to establish himself as near to his ancestral home as he could , and his second be to cultivate a friendship with and with the neighbour . " the baronet himself tell him about the family hound , and so prepare the way for his own death . , as i will continue to call him , know that the old man 's heart be weak and that a shock would kill him . so much he have learn from . he have hear also that be superstitious and have take this grim legend very seriously . his ingenious mind instantly suggest a way by which the baronet could be do to death , and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer . " have conceive the idea he proceed to carry it out with considerable finesse . an ordinary schemer would have be content to work with a savage hound . the use of artificial mean to make the creature diabolical be a flash of genius upon his part . the dog he buy in from and , the dealer in . it be the strong and most savage in their possession . he bring it down by the line and walk a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without excite any remark . he have already on his insect hunt learn to penetrate the , and so have find a safe hiding-place for the creature . here he kennel it and wait his chance . " but it be some time come . the old gentleman could not be decoy outside of his ground at night . several time lurk about with his hound , but without avail . it be during these fruitless quest that he , or rather his ally , be see by peasant , and that the legend of the demon dog receive a new confirmation . he have hope that his wife might lure to his ruin , but here she prove unexpectedly independent . she would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy . threat and even , i be sorry to say , blow refuse to move her . she would have nothing to do with it , and for a time be at a deadlock . " he find a way out of his difficulty through the chance that , who have conceive a friendship for him , make him the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman , . by represent himself as a single man he acquire complete influence over her , and he give her to understand that in the event of her obtain a divorce from her husband he would marry her . his plan be suddenly bring to a head by his knowledge that be about to leave the on the advice of , with whose opinion he himself pretend to coincide . he must act at once , or his victim might get beyond his power . he therefore put pressure upon to write this letter , implore the old man to give her an interview on the evening before his departure for . he then , by a specious argument , prevent her from go , and so have the chance for which he have wait . " drive back in the evening from he be in time to get his hound , to treat it with his infernal paint , and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he have reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting . the dog , incite by its master , spring over the wicket-gate and pursue the unfortunate baronet , who flee scream down the yew alley . in that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have be a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature , with its flaming jaw and blaze eye , bound after its victim . he fall dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and terror . the hound have keep upon the grassy border while the baronet have run down the path , so that no track but the man 's be visible . on see him lie still the creature have probably approach to sniff at him , but find him dead have turn away again . it be then that it leave the print which be actually observe by . the hound be call off and hurry away to its lair in the , and a mystery be leave which puzzle the authority , alarm the countryside , and finally bring the case within the scope of our observation . " so much for the death of . you perceive the devilish cunning of it , for really it would be almost impossible to make a case against the real murderer . his only accomplice be one who could never give him away , and the grotesque , inconceivable nature of the device only serve to make it more effective . both of the woman concern in the case , and , be leave with a strong suspicion against . know that he have design upon the old man , and also of the existence of the hound . know neither of these thing , but have be impress by the death occur at the time of an appointment which be only know to him . however , both of them be under his influence , and he have nothing to fear from them . the first half of his task be successfully accomplish but the more difficult still remain . " it be possible that do not know of the existence of an heir in . in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend , and he be tell by the latter all detail about the arrival of . 's first idea be that this young stranger from might possibly be do to death in without come down to at all . he distrust his wife ever since she have refuse to help him in lay a trap for the old man , and he dare not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her . it be for this reason that he take her to with him . they lodge , i find , at the , in , which be actually one of those call upon by my agent in search of evidence . here he keep his wife imprison in her room while he , disguise in a beard , follow to and afterwards to the station and to the . his wife have some inkling of his plan ; but she have such a fear of her fear found upon brutal she dare not write to warn the man whom she know to be in danger . if the letter should fall into 's hand her own life would not be safe . eventually , as we know , she adopt the expedient of cut out the word which would form the message , and address the letter in a disguised hand . it reach the baronet , and give him the first warning of his danger . " it be very essential for to get some article of 's attire so that , in case he be drive to use the dog , he might always have the means of set him upon his track . with characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once , and we can doubt that the boot or of the hotel be well bribe to help him in his design . by chance , however , the first boot which be procure for him be a new one and , therefore , useless for his purpose . he then have it return and obtain most instructive incident , since it prove conclusively to my mind that we be deal with a real hound , as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to a new one . the more outre and grotesque an incident be the more carefully it deserve to be examine , and the very point which appear to complicate a case be , when duly consider and scientifically handle , the one which be most likely to elucidate it . " then we have the visit from our friend next morning , shadow always by in the cab . from his knowledge of our room and of my appearance , as well as from his general conduct , i be incline to think that 's career of crime have be by no mean limit to this single affair . it be suggestive that during the last three year there have be four considerable burglary in the west country , for none of which be any criminal ever arrest . the last of these , at , in , be remarkable for the cold-blooded pistol of the page , who surprise the masked and solitary burglar . i can doubt that recruit his wane resource in this fashion , and that for year he have be a desperate and dangerous man . " we have an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he get away from us so successfully , and also of his audacity in send back my own name to me through the cabman . from that moment he understand that i have take over the case in , and that therefore there be no chance for him there . he return to and await the arrival of the baronet . " " one moment ! " say " you have , no doubt , describe the sequence of event correctly , but there be one point which you have leave unexplained . what become of the hound when its master be in ? " " i have give some attention to this matter and it be undoubtedly of importance . there can be no question that have a confidant , though it be unlikely that he ever place himself in his power by share all his plan with him . there be an old manservant at , whose name be . his connection with the can be trace for several year , as far back as the day , so that he must have be aware that his master and mistress be really husband and wife . this man have disappear and have escape from the country . it be suggestive that be not a common name in , while be so in all spanish or spanish-american country . the man , like herself , speak good english , but with a curious lisp accent . i have myself see this old man cross the by the path which have mark out . it be very probable , therefore , that in the absence of his master it be he who care for the hound , though he may never have know the purpose for which the beast be use . " the then go down to , whither they be soon follow by and you . one word now as to how i stand myself at that time . it may possibly recur to your memory that when i examine the paper upon which the printed word be fasten i make a close inspection for the . in do so i hold it within a few inch of my eye , and be conscious of a faint smell of the scent know as white jessamine . there be perfume , which it be very necessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each other , and case have more than once within my own experience depend upon their prompt recognition . the scent suggest the presence of a lady , and already my thought begin to turn towards the . thus i have make certain of the hound , and have guess at the criminal before ever we go to the west country . " it be my game to watch . it be evident , however , that i could not do this if i be with you , since he would be keenly on his guard . i deceive everybody , therefore , yourself include , and i come down secretly when i be suppose to be in . my hardship be not so great as you imagine , though such trifling detail must never interfere with the investigation of a case . i stay for the most part at , and only use the hut upon the moor when it be necessary to be near the scene of action . have come down with me , and in his disguise as a country boy he be of great assistance to me . i be dependent upon him for food and clean linen . when i be watch , be frequently watch you , so that i be able to keep my hand upon all the string . " i have already tell you that your report reach me rapidly , be forward instantly from to . they be of great service to me , and especially that one incidentally truthful piece of biography of 's . i be able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and know at last exactly how i stand . the case have be considerably complicate through the incident of the escape convict and the relation between him and the . this also you clear up in a very effective way , though i have already come to the same conclusion from my own observation . " by the time that you discover me upon the moor i have a complete knowledge of the whole business , but i have not a case which could go to a jury . even 's attempt upon that night which end in the death of the unfortunate convict do not help us much in prove murder against our man . there seem to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed , and to do so we have to use , alone and apparently unprotected , as a bait . we do so , and at the cost of a severe shock to our client we succeed in complete our case and drive to his destruction . that should have be expose to this be , i must confess , a reproach to my management of the case , but we have no means of foresee the terrible and paralyze spectacle which the beast present , nor could we predict the fog which enable him to burst upon us at such short notice . we succeed in our object at a cost which both the specialist and assure me will be a temporary one . a long journey may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered nerve but also from his wounded feeling . his love for the lady be deep and sincere , and to him the sad part of all this black business be that he should have be deceive by her . " it only remain to indicate the part which she have play throughout . there can be no doubt that exercise an influence over her which may have be love or may have be fear , or very possibly both , since they be by no mean incompatible emotion . it be , at least , absolutely effective . at his command she consent to pass as his sister , though he find the limit of his power over her when he endeavour to make her the direct accessory to murder . she be ready to warn so far as she could without implicate her husband , and again and again she try to do so . himself seem to have be capable of jealousy , and when he see the baronet pay court to the lady , even though it be part of his own plan , still he could not help interrupt with a passionate outburst which reveal the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so cleverly conceal . by encourage the intimacy he make it certain that would frequently come to and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desire . on the day of the crisis , however , his wife turn suddenly against him . she have learn something of the death of the convict , and she know that the hound be be keep in the outhouse on the evening that be come to dinner . she tax her husband with his intended crime , and a furious scene follow in which he show her for the first time that she have a rival in his love . her fidelity turn in an instant to bitter hatred , and he see that she would betray him . he tie her up , therefore , that she might have no chance of warn , and he hope , no doubt , that when the whole countryside put down the baronet 's death to the curse of his family , as they certainly would do , he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and to keep silent upon what she know . in this i fancy that in any case he make a miscalculation , and that , if we have not be there , his doom would none the less have be seal . a woman of spanish blood do not condone such an injury so lightly . and now , my dear , without refer to my note , i can give you a more detailed account of this curious case . i do not know that anything essential have be leave unexplained . " " he could not hope to frighten to death as he have do the old uncle with his bogie hound . " " the beast be savage and . if its appearance do not frighten its victim to death , at least it would paralyze the resistance which might be offer . " " no doubt . there only remain one difficulty . if come into the succession , how could he explain the fact that he , the heir , have be live unannounced under another name so close to the property ? how could he claim it without cause suspicion and inquiry ? " " it be a formidable difficulty , and i fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it . the past and the present be within the field of my inquiry , but what a man may do in the future be a hard question to answer . have hear her husband discuss the problem on several occasion . there be three possible course . he might claim the property from , establish his identity before the british authority there and so obtain the fortune without ever come to at all , or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in ; or , again , he might furnish an accomplice with the proof and paper , put him in as heir , and retain a claim upon some proportion of his income . we can doubt from what we know of him that he would have find some way out of the difficulty . and now , my dear , we have have some week of severe work , and for one evening , i think , we may turn our thought into more pleasant channel . i have a box for ' huguenot . ' you hear the ? might i trouble you then to be ready in half an hour , and we can stop at 's for a little dinner on the way ? "
