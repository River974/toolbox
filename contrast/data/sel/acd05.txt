it be the sort of window which be common in about the end of the seventeenth century . it be high , mullioned , with a broad transom across the centre , and above the middle of the transom a tiny coat of caltrop gules upon a field into the glass . outside there project a stout iron rod , from which hang a gilded miniature of a bale of wool which swing and squeak with every puff of wind . beyond that again be the house of the other side , high , narrow , and prim , slash with diagonal in front , and top with a bristle of sharp gable and corner turret . between be the cobble-stone of the and the clatter of innumerable foot . inside , the window be furnish with a broad of brown stamp spanish leather , where the family might recline and have an eye from behind the curtain on all that be go forward in the busy world beneath them . two of them sit there now , a man and a woman , but their back be turn to the spectacle , and their face to the large and richly furnished room . from time to time they steal a glance at each other , and their eye tell that they need no other sight to make them happy . nor be it to be wonder at , for they be a well-favoured pair . she be very young , twenty at the most , with a face which be pale , indeed , and yet of a brilliant pallor , which be so clear and fresh , and carry with it such a suggestion of purity and innocence , that one would not wish its maiden grace to be mar by an intrusion of colour . her feature be delicate and sweet , and her hair and long dark eyelash form a piquant contrast to her dreamy gray eye and her ivory skin . in her whole expression there be something quiet and subdued , which be accentuate by her simple dress of black taffeta , and by the little jet brooch and bracelet which be her sole ornament . such be , the only daughter of the famous huguenot . but if her dress be sombre , it be atone for by the magnificence of her companion . he be a man who might have be ten year her senior , with a keen soldier face , small well-marked feature , a carefully trim black moustache , and a dark hazel eye which might harden to command a man , or soften to supplicate a woman , and be successful at either . his coat be of sky-blue , slash across with silver braiding , and with broad silver shoulder-strap on either side . a vest of white peep out from beneath it , and knee-breeches of the same disappear into high polished boot with gilt spur upon the heel . a rapier and a plume cap lie upon a settle beside him complete a costume which be a badge of honour to the wearer , for any frenchman would have recognise it as be that of an officer in the famous of the . a trim , dashing soldier he look , with his curl black hair and head . such he have prove himself before now in the field , too , until the name of have become conspicuous among the thousand of the valiant lesser noblesse who have flock into the service of the king . they be first cousin , these two , and there be just sufficient resemblance in the clear-cut feature to recall the relationship . be spring from a noble huguenot family , but have lose his parent early he have join the army , and have work his way without influence and against all odd to his present position . his father 's young brother , however , find every path to fortune bar to him through the persecution to which man of his faith be already subject , have drop the " de " which imply his noble descent , and he have take to trade in the city of , with such success that he be now one of the rich and most prominent citizen of the town . it be under his roof that the guardsman now sit , and it be his only daughter whose white hand he hold in his own . " tell me , , " say he , " why do you look troubled ? " " i be not trouble , , " " come , there be just one little line between those curve brow . ah , i can read you , you see , as a shepherd read the sky . " " it be nothing , , -- " " but what ?

" " ah , , when you talk of the king and the court and the grand lady , you fill me with wonder . " " and why with wonder ? " " to think that you who live amid such splendour should stoop to the humble room of a mercer . " " ah , but what do the room contain ? " " there be the great wonder of all . that you who pass your day amid such people , so beautiful , so witty , should think me worthy of your love , me , who be such a quiet little mouse , all alone in this great house , so shy and so backward ! it be wonderful ! " " every man have his own taste , " say her cousin , stroke the tiny hand . " it be with woman as with flower . some may prefer the great brilliant sunflower , or the rose , which be so bright and large that it must ever catch the eye . but give me the little violet which hide among the moss , and yet be so sweet to look upon , and shed its fragrance round it . but still that line upon your brow , dear . " " i be wish that father would return . " " and why ? be you so lonely , then ? " her pale face light up with a quick smile . " i shall not be lonely until . but i be always uneasy when he be away . one hear so much now of the persecution of our poor brethren . " " tut ! my uncle can defy them . " " he have go to the provost of the about this notice of the quartering of the dragoon . " " ah , you have not tell me of that . " " here it be . " she rise and take up a slip of blue paper with a red seal dangle from it which lie upon the table . his strong , black brow knit together as he glance at it .

" know well how this method of annoy huguenot have be practise all over , but he have flatter himself that his own position at court would have insure his kinsman from such an outrage . he throw the paper down with an exclamation of anger . " when do they come ? " " father say . " " then they shall not be here long . i shall have an order to remove them . but the sun have sink behind 's , and i should already be upon my way . " " no , no ; you must not go yet . " " i would that i could give you into your father 's charge first , for i fear to leave you alone when these trooper may come . and yet no excuse will avail me if i be not at . but see , a horseman have stop before the door . he be not in uniform . perhaps he be a messenger from your father . " the girl run eagerly to the window , and peer out , with her hand rest upon her cousin 's shoulder . " ah ! " she cry , " i have forget . it be the man from . say that he would come . " " the man from ! " repeat the soldier , in a tone of surprise , and they both crane their neck from the window . the horseman , a sturdy , broad-shouldered young man , clean-shaven and , turn his long , swarthy face and his bold feature in their direction as he run his eye over the front of the house . he have a gray hat of a shape which be strange to parisian eye , but his sombre clothes and high boot be such as any citizen might have wear . yet his general appearance be so unusual that a group of townsfolk have already assemble round him , stare with open mouth at his horse and himself . a battered gun with an extremely long barrel be fasten by the stock to his stirrup , while the muzzle stick up into the air behind him . at each holster be a large dangling black bag , and a gaily colour blanket be roll up at the back of his saddle . his horse , a , all shiny with sweat above , and all cake with mud beneath , bend its fore knee as it stand , as though it be overspend . the rider , however , have satisfy himself as to the house , spring lightly out of his saddle , and disengage his gun , his blanket , and his bag , push his way unconcernedly through the gape crowd and knock loudly at the door . " who be he , then ? " ask . " a canadian ? i be almost one myself . i have as many friend on one side of the sea as on the other . perchance i know him . there be not so many white face yonder , and in two year there be scarce one from the saguenay to that i have not see . " " nay , he be from the english province , . but he speak our tongue . his mother be of our blood . " " and his name ? " " be , those name ! yes , , that be . his father and mine have do much trade together , and now his son , who , as i understand , have live ever in the wood , be send here to see something of man and city . ah , my ! what can have happen now ? " a sudden chorus of scream and cry have break out from the passage beneath , with the shouting of a man and the sound of rush step . in an instant be half-way down the stair , and be stare in amazement at the scene in the hall beneath . two maid stand , scream at the pitch of their lung , at either side . in the centre the age , a stern old calvinist , whose dignity have never before be shake , be spin round , wave his arm , and roar so that he might have be hear at the . attach to the gray worsted stocking which cover his calf be a fluffy black hairy ball , with one little red eye glance up , and the gleam of two white tooth where it hold its grip . at the shriek , the young stranger , who have go out to his horse , come rush back , and pluck the creature off , he slap it twice across the snout , and plunge it back into the leather bag from which it have emerge . " it be nothing , " say he , speak in excellent ; " it be only a bear . " " ah , my ! " cry , wipe the drop from his brow . " ah , it have age me five year ! i be at the door , bow to monsieur , and in a moment it have me from behind . " " it be my fault for leave the bag loose . the creature be but pup the day we leave , six week come . do i speak with my father 's friend , monsieur ? " " no , monsieur , " say the guardsman , from the staircase . " my uncle be out , but i be , at your service , and here be mademoiselle , who be your hostess . " the stranger ascend the stair , and pay his greeting to them both with the air of a man who be as shy as a wild deer , and yet who have steel himself to carry a thing through . he walk with them to the sitting-room , and then in an instant be go again , and they hear his foot thud upon the stair . presently he be back , with a lovely glossy skin in his hand . " the bear be for your father , mademoiselle , " say he . " this little skin i have bring from for you . it be but a trifle , and yet it may serve to make a pair of or a pouch . " give a cry of delight as her hand sink into the depth of its softness . she might well admire it , for no king in the world could have have a fine skin . " ah , it be beautiful , monsieur , " she cry ; " and what creature be it ? and where do it come from ? " " it be a black fox . i shoot it myself last fall up near the iroquois village at . " she press it to her cheek , her white face show up like marble against its absolute blackness . " i be sorry my father be not here to welcome you , monsieur , " she say ; " but i do so very heartily in his place . your room be above . will show you to it , if you wish . " " my room ? for what ? " " why , monsieur , to sleep in ! " " and must i sleep in a room ? " laugh at the gloomy face of the . " you shall not sleep there if you do not wish , " say he . the other brighten at once and step across to the further window , which look down upon the . " ah , " he cry . " there be a there , mademoiselle , and if i might take my blanket out yonder , i should like it good than any room . in winter , indeed , one must do it , but in summer i be smother with a ceiling press down upon me . " " you be not from a town then ? " say . " my father life in door from the house of , of whom you must have hear . he be a very hardy man , and he can do it , but a few day of or of be enough for me . my life have be in the wood . " " i be sure my father would wish you to sleep where you like and to do what you like , as long as it make you happy . " " i thank you , mademoiselle . then i shall take my thing out there , and i shall groom my horse . " " nay , there be . " " i be use to do it myself . " " then i will come with you , " say , " for i would have a word with you . until , then , , farewell ! " " until , . " the two young man pass downstairs together , and the guardsman follow the american out into the yard . " you have have a long journey , " he say . " yes ; from . " " be you tired ? " " no ; i be seldom tired . " " remain with the lady , then , until her father come back . " " why do you say that ? " " because i have to go , and she might need a protector . " the stranger say nothing , but he nod , and throw off his black coat , set to work vigorously rub down his travel-stained horse . it be the morning after the guardsman have return to his duty . eight o'clock have strike on the great clock of , and it be almost time for the monarch to rise . through all the long corridor and passage of the monster palace there be a subdued hum and rustle , with a low muffle stir of preparation , for the rise of the king be a great state function in which many have a part to play . a servant with a steam silver saucer hurried past , bear it to monsieur , the state barber . other , with clothes throw over their arm , bustle down the passage which lead to the . the knot of guardsman in their gorgeous blue and silver coat straighten themselves up and bring their halberd to attention , while the young officer , who have be look wistfully out of the window at some courtier who be laugh and chat on the terrace , turn sharply upon his heel , and stride over to the white and gold door of the royal bedroom . he have hardly take his stand there before the handle be very gently turn from within , the door revolve noiselessly upon its hinge , and a man slide silently through the aperture , close it again behind him . " hush ! " say he , with his finger to his thin , precise lip , while his whole clean-shaven face and brow be an entreaty and a warning . " the king still sleep . " the word be whisper from one to another among the group who have assemble outside the door . the speaker , who be monsieur , head valet , give a sign to the officer of the guard , and lead him into the window alcove from which he have lately come . " , , " say he , with a mixture of familiarity and respect in his manner . " , . how have the king sleep ? " " admirably . " " but it be his time . " " hardly . " " you will not rouse him yet ? " " in seven and a half minute . " the valet pull out the little round watch which give the law to the man who be the law to twenty million of people . " who command at the main guard ? " " . " " and you will be here ? " " for four hour i attend the king . " " very good . he give me some instruction for the officer of the guard , when he be alone last night after the petit coucher . he bid me to say that monsieur be not to be admit to the grand lever . you be to tell him so . " " i shall do so . " " then , should a note come from her -- understand me , the new one- -- " " madame de ? " " precisely . but it be more discreet not to mention name . should she send a note , you will take it and deliver it quietly when the king give you an opportunity . " " it shall be do . " " but if the other should come , as be possible other , you understand me , the -- " " madame de . " " ah , that soldierly tongue of yours , captain ! should she come , i say , you will gently bar her way , with courteous word , you understand , but on no account be she to be permit to enter the royal room . " " very good , . " " and now we have but three minute . " he stride through the rapidly increase group of people in the corridor with an air of proud humility as befit a man who , if he be a valet , be at least the king of valet , by be the valet of the king . close by the door stand a line of footman , resplendent in their powdered wig , red plush coat , and silver shoulder knot . " be the officer of the oven here ? " ask . " yes , sir , " reply a functionary who bear in front of him an enamel tray heap with pine shaving . " the opener of the shutter ? " " here , sir . " " the remover of the taper ? " " here , sir . " " be ready for the word . " he turn the handle once more , and slip into the darken room . it be a large square apartment , with two high window upon the further side , curtain across with priceless velvet hanging . through the chink the morning sun shoot a few little gleam , which widen as they cross the room to break in bright blur of light upon the wall . a large stand by the side of the burnt-out fire , shadow over by the huge marble , the back of which be carry up twine and curve into a thousand arabesque and armorial device until it blend with the richly paint ceiling . in one corner a narrow couch with a rug throw across it show where the faithful have spend the night . in the very centre of the chamber there stand a large bed , with curtain of gobelin tapestry loop back from the pillow . a square of polished rail surround it , leave a space some five foot in width all round between the enclosure and the bedside . within this enclosure , or , stand a small round table , cover over with a white napkin , upon which lie a silver platter and an enamel cup , the one contain a little wine and water , the other bearing three slice of the breast of a chicken , in case the king should hunger during the night . as pass noiselessly across the room , his foot sink into the carpet , there be the heavy close smell of sleep in the air , and he could near the long thin breathing of the sleeper . he pass through the opening in the rail , and stand , watch in hand , wait for the exact instant when the iron routine of the court demand that the monarch should be rouse . beneath him , from under the costly green coverlet of oriental silk , half bury in the fluffy lace which edge the pillow , there protrude a round black bristle of close-cropped hair , with the profile of a curve nose and petulant lip outline against the white background . the valet snap his watch , and bent over the sleeper . " i have the honour to inform your majesty that it be eight , " say he . " ah ! " the king slowly open his large eye , make the sign of the cross , and kiss a little dark reliquary which he draw from under his . then he sit up in bed , and blink about him with the air of a man who be collect his thought . " do you give my order to the officer of the guard , ? " he ask . " yes , sire . " " who be on duty ? " " at the main guard , and in the corridor . " " ! ah , the young man who stop my horse at . i remember him . you may give the signal , . " the chief valet walk swiftly across to the door and throw it open . in rush the officer of the oven and the four red-coated , footman , , , each intent upon his own duty . the one seize upon 's rug and couch , and in an instant have whip them off into an , another have carry away the en cas meal and the silver ; while a third draw back the great curtain of stamp velvet and let a flood of light into the apartment . then , as the flame be already flicker among the pine shaving in the fireplace , the officer of the oven place two round log crosswise above them , for the morning air be chilly , and withdraw with his . they be hardly go before a more august group enter the . two walk together in front , the one a youth little over twenty year of age , middle-sized , incline to stoutness , with a slow , pompous bearing , a well-turned leg , and a face which be comely enough in a fashion , but which be devoid of any shadow of expression , except perhaps of an occasional lurk gleam of mischievous humour . he be richly clad in velvet , with a broad band of blue silk ; across his breast , and the glitter edge of the order of protrude from under it . his companion be a man of forty , swarthy , dignified , and solemn , in a plain but rich dress of black silk , with slash of gold at the neck and sleeve . as the pair face the king there be sufficient resemblance between the three face to show that they be of one blood , and to enable a stranger to guess that the old be monsieur , the young brother of the king , while the other be the , his only legitimate child , and heir to a throne to which in the strange working of neither he nor his son be destine to ascend . strong as be the likeness between the three face , each with the curve bourbon nose , the large full eye , and the thick , their common heritage from of , there be still a vast difference of temperament and character stamp upon their feature . the king be now in his year , and the crop black head be already thin a little on the top , and shade away to gray over the temple . he still , however , retain much of the beauty of his youth , temper by the dignity and sternness which increase with his year . his dark eye be full of expression , and his clear-cut feature be the delight of the sculptor and the painter . his firm and yet sensitive mouth and his thick , brow give an air of authority and power to his face , while the more subdued expression which be habitual to his brother mark the man whose whole life have be spend in one long exercise of deference and self-effacement . the dauphin , on the other hand , with a more regular face than his father , have none of that quick play of feature when excite , or that kingly serenity when compose , which have make a shrewd observer say that , if he be not the great monarch that ever live , be at least the well fitted to act the part . behind the king 's son and the king 's brother there enter a little group of notable and of official whom duty have call to this daily ceremony . there be the grand master of the robe , the first lord of the , the , a pale youth clad in black velvet , limp heavily with his left leg , and his little brother , the young , both of them the illegitimate son of madame and the king . behind them , again , be the first valet of the wardrobe , follow by , the first physician , , the head surgeon , and three page in scarlet and gold who bear the royal clothes . such be the partaker in the family entry , the high honour which the court of could aspire to . have pour on the king 's hand a few drop of spirit of wine , catch them again in a silver dish ; and the first lord of the bedchamber have present the bowl of holy water with which he make the sign of the cross , mutter to himself the short office of the . then , with a nod to his brother and a short word of greet to the dauphin and to the due , he swing his leg over the side of the bed and sit in his long silken , his little white foot dangle from beneath perilous position for any man to assume , be it not that he have so a sense of his own dignity that he could not realise that under any circumstance it might be compromise in the eye of other . so he sit , the master of , yet the slave to every puff of wind , for a wandering draught have set him shiver and shake . monsieur , the noble barber , fling a purple dressing-gown over the royal shoulder , and place a long court wig upon his head , while draw on his red stocking and lay before him his slipper of embroider velvet . the monarch thrust his foot into them , tie his dressing-gown , and pass out to the fireplace , where he settle himself down in his easy-chair , hold out his thin delicate hand towards the blaze log , while the other stand round in a semicircle , wait for the grand lever which be to follow . " how be this , monsieur ? " the king ask suddenly , glance round him with a petulant face . " i be conscious of a smell of scent . surely none of you would venture to bring perfume into the presence , know , as you must all do , how offensive it be to me . " the little group glance from one to the other with protestation of innocence . the faithful , however , with his stealthy step , have pass along behind them , and have detect the offender . " my lord of , the smell come from you , " he say . the , a little lad , flush up at the detection . " if you please , sire , it be possible that mademoiselle may have wet my coat with her when we all play together at yesterday , " he stammer . " i have not observe it , but if it offend your -- " " take it away ! take it away ! " cry the king . " ! it choke and stifle me ! open the low casement , . no ; never heed , now that he be go . monsieur , be not this our shaving morning ? " " yes , sire ; all be ready . " " then why not proceed ? it be three minute after the accustomed time . to work , sir ; and you , , give word for the grand lever . " it be obvious that the king be not in a very good humour that morning . he dart little quick question glance at his brother and at his son , but whatever complaint or sarcasm may have tremble upon his lip , be effectually stifle by 's ministration . with the nonchalance bear of long custom , the official cover the royal chin with soap , draw the razor swiftly round it , and sponge over the surface with spirit of wine . a nobleman then help to draw on the king 's black velvet , a second assist in arrange them , while a third draw the over the shoulder , and hand the royal shirt , which have be warm before the fire . his shoe , his gaiter , and his scarlet inner vest be successively fasten by noble courtier , each keenly jealous of his own privilege , and over the vest be place the blue ribbon with the cross of the in diamond , and that of tie with red . to one to whom the sight be new , it might have seem strange to see the little man , listless , passive , with his eye fix thoughtfully on the burning log , while this group of man , each with a historic name , bustle round him , add a touch here and a touch there , like a knot of child with a favourite doll . the black undercoat be draw on , the cravat of rich lace adjust , the loose overcoat secure , two handkerchief of costly point carry forward upon an enamel saucer , and thrust by separate official into each side pocket , the silver and ebony cane lay to hand , and the monarch be ready for the labour of the day . during the half-hour or so which have be occupy in this manner there have be a constant opening and closing of the chamber door , and a mutter of name from the captain of the guard to the attendant in charge , and from the attendant in charge to the first gentleman of the chamber , end always in the admission of some new visitor . each as he enter bow profoundly three time , as a salute to majesty , and then attach himself to his own little clique or coterie , to gossip in a low voice over the news , the weather , and the plan of the day . gradually the number increase , until by the time the king 's frugal first breakfast of bread and twice water wine have be carry in , the large square chamber be quite fill with a throng of man many of whom have help to make the epoch the most illustrious of french history . here , close by the king , be the harsh but energetic , all-powerful now since the death of his rival , discuss a question of military organisation with two officer , the one a tall and stately soldier , the other a strange little figure , undersized and misshapen , but bear the insignia of a marshal of , and own a name which be of evil omen over the dutch frontier , for be look upon already as the successor of , even as his companion be of . beside them , a small white-haired clerical with a kindly face , , confessor to the king , be whisper his view upon to the portly , the eloquent of , and to the tall thin young , who listen with a clouded brow , for it be suspect that his own opinion be taint with the heresy in question . there , too , be , the painter , discuss art in a small circle which contain his and , the architect and , and sculptor , , , and , whose work have do so much to beautify the new palace of the king . close to the door , , with his handsome face wreathe in smile , be chat with the poet and the architect , the three laugh and jest with the freedom which be natural to the favourite servant of the king , the only subject who might walk unannounced and without ceremony into and out of his chamber . " what be amiss with him this morning ? " ask in a whisper , nod his head in the direction of the royal group . " i fear that his sleep have not improve his temper . " " he become hard and hard to amuse , " say , shake his head . " i be to be at madame 's room at three to see whether a page or two of the may not work a change . " " my friend , " say the architect , " do you not think that madame herself might be a good consoler than your ? " " madame be a wonderful woman . she have brain , she have heart , she have be admirable . " " and yet she have one gift too many . " " and that be ? " " age . " " ! what matter her year when she can carry them like thirty ? what an eye ! what an arm ! and besides , my friend , he be not himself a boy any longer . " " ah , but that be another thing . " " a man 's age be an incident , a woman be a calamity . " " very true . but a young man consult his eye , and an old man his ear . over forty , it be the clever tongue which win ; under it , the pretty face . " " ah , you rascal ! then you have make up your mind that year with tact will hold the field against with beauty . well , when your lady have win , she will doubtless remember who be the first to pay court to her . " " but i think that you be wrong , . " " well , we shall see . " " and if you be -- " " well , what then ? " " then it may be a little serious for you . " " and why ? " " the have a memory . " " her influence may soon be nothing more . " " do not rely too much upon it , my friend . when the come up from , with her blue eye and her copper hair , it be in every man 's mouth that have have her day . yet be six foot under a church crypt , and the marquise spend two hour with the king last week . she have win once , and may again . " " ah , but this be a very different rival . this be no slip of a country girl , but the clever woman in . " " , , you know our good master well , or you should , for you seem to have be at his elbow since the day of the . be he a man , think you , to be amuse forever by sermon , or to spend his day at the foot of a lady of that age , watch her at her , and fondle her poodle , when all the fair face and bright eye of be as thick in his salon as the tulip in a dutch ? no , no , it will be the , or if not she , some young beauty . " " my dear , i say again that her sun be set . have you not hear the news ? " " not a word . " " her brother , monsieur , have be refuse the entre . " " impossible ! " " but it be a fact . " " and when ? " " this very morning . " " from whom have you it ? " " from , the captain of the guard . he have his order to bar the way to him . " " ! then the king do indeed mean mischief . that be why his brow be so cloudy this morning , then . by my faith , if the marquise have the spirit with which folk credit her , he may find that it be easy to win her than to slight her . " " ay ; the be no easy race to handle . " " well , heaven send him a safe way out of it ! but who be this gentleman ? his face be somewhat grim than those to which the court be accustom . ! the king catch sight of him , and beckon to him to advance . by my faith , he be one who would be more at his ease in a tent than under a painted ceiling . " the stranger who have attract 's attention be a tall thin man , with a high aquiline nose , stern fierce gray eye , peep out from under tufted brow , and a countenance so line and mark by age , care , and stress of weather that it stand out amid the prim courtier face which surround it as an old hawk might in a cage of bird of gay plumage . he be clad in a suit which have become usual at court since the king have put aside frivolity and , but the sword which hang from his waist be no fancy rapier , but a good blade in a stain , which show every sign of have see hard service . he have be stand near the door , his beaver in his hand , glance with a , expression at the group of gossip around him , but at the sign from the minister of war he begin to elbow his way forward , push aside in no very ceremonious fashion all who bar his passage . possess in a high degree the royal faculty of recognition . " it be year since i have see him , but i remember his face well , " say he , turn to his minister . " it be the , be it not ? " " yes , sire , " answer ; " it be indeed , , and formerly governor of . " " we be glad to see you once more at our lever , " say the monarch , as the old nobleman stoop his head , and kiss the white hand which be extend to him . " i hope that the cold of have not chill the warmth of your loyalty . " " only death itself , sire , would be cold enough for that . " " then i trust that it may remain to us for many long year . we would thank you for the care and pain which you have spend upon our province , and if we have recall you , it be chiefly that we would fain hear from your own lip how all thing go there . and first , as the affair of take precedence of those of , how do the conversion of the heathen prosper ? " " we can complain , sire . the good father , both jesuit and , have do their good , though indeed they be both rather ready to abandon the affair of the next world in order to meddle with those of this . " " what say you to that , father ? " ask , glance , with a twinkle of the eye , at his jesuit confessor . " i say , sire , that when the affair of this world have a bearing upon those of the next , it be indeed the duty of a good priest , as of every other good , to guide them right . " " that be very true , sire , " say , with an angry flush upon his swarthy cheek ; " but as long as your do me the honour to intrust those affair no my own guidance , i would brook no interference in the performance of my duty , whether the meddler be clad in coat or cassock . " " enough , sir , enough ! " say sharply . " i have ask you about the mission . " " they prosper , sire . there be iroquois at the and the mountain , at , and along the whole river cote from in the to la , and even the great plain of the , who have all take the cross as their token . have pass down the river of the to preach among the , and jesuit have carry the to the warrior of the in their wigwam at . " " i may add , your majesty , " say , " that in leave the truth there , they have too often leave their life with it . " " yes , sire , it be very true , " cry cordially . " your majesty have many brave man within your domain , but none brave than these . they have come back up the from the iroquois village with their nail go , their finger tear out , a cinder where their eye should be , and the scar of the pine splinter as thick upon their body as the fleur-de-lis on yonder curtain . yet , with a month of nursing from the good , they have use their remain eye to guide them back to the indian country once more , where even the dog have be frighten at their haggle face and twisted limb . " " and you have suffer this ? " cry hotly . " you allow these infamous assassin to live ? " " i have ask for troop , sire . " " and i have send some . " " one regiment . " " the . i have no good in my service . " but more be need , sire . " " there be the canadian themselves . have you not a militia ? could you not raise force enough to punish these rascally murderer of 's priest ? i have always understand that you be a soldier . " 's eye flash , and a quick answer seem for an instant to tremble upon his lip , but with an effort the fiery old man restrain himself . " your majesty will learn good whether i be a soldier or not , " say he , " by ask those who have see me at , , , and half a score of other place where i have the honour of uphold your 's cause . " " your service have not be forget . " " it be just because i be a soldier and have see something of war that i know how hard it be to penetrate into a country much large than the , all thick with forest and bog , with a savage lurk behind every tree , who , if he have not learn to step in time or to form line , can at least bring down the run caribou at two hundred pace , and travel three league to your one . and then when you have at last reach their village , and burn their empty wigwam and a few acre of maize field , what the good be you then ? you can but travel back again to your own land with a cloud of unseen man lurk behind you , and a for every straggler . you be a soldier yourself , sire . i ask you if such a war be an easy task for a handful of soldier , with a few straight from the plough , and a troop of whose heart be all the time be with their traps and their . " " no , no ; i be sorry if i speak too hastily , " say . " we shall look into the matter at our council . " " then it warm my heart to hear you say so , " cry the old governor . " there will be joy down the long , in white heart and in red , when it be know that their great father over the water have turn his mind towards them . " " and yet you must not look for too much , for have be a heavy cost to us , and we have many call in . " " ah , sire , i would that you could see that great land . when your majesty have win a campaign over here , what may come of it ? , a few mile of land , , one more city in the kingdom ; but over there , with a tenth of the cost and a hundredth part of the force , there be a world ready to your hand . it be so vast , sire , so rich , so beautiful ! where be there such hill , such forest , such river ? and it be all for us if we will but take it . who be there to stand in our way ? a few nation of scattered and a thin strip of english farmer and fisherman . turn your thought there , sire , and in a few year you would be able to stand upon your citadel at , and to say there be one great empire here from the snow of the to the warm , and from the wave of the ocean to the great plain beyond 's river , and the name of this empire be , and her king be , and her flag be the fleur-de-lis . " 's cheek have flush at this ambitious picture , and he have lean forward in his chair , with flash eye , but he sink back again as the governor conclude . " on my word , count , " say he , " you have catch something of this gift of indian eloquence of which we have hear . but about these english folk . they be huguenot , be they not ? " " for the most part . especially in the . " " then it might be a service to to send them pack . they have a city there , i be tell . do they call it ? " " , sire . they take it from the . " " ah , . and have i not hear of another ? -- " " , sire . " " that be the name . the harbour might be of service to us . tell me , now , , " lower his voice so that his word might be audible only to the count , , and the royal circle , " what force would you need to clear these people out ? one regiment , two regiment , and perhaps a frigate or two ? " but the ex-governor shake his grizzled head . " you do not know them , sire , " say he . " they be stern folk , these . we in , with all your gracious help , have find it hard to hold our own . yet these man have have no help , but only hindrance , with cold and disease , and barren land , and indian war , but they have thrive and multiply until the wood thin away in front of them like ice in the sun , and their church bell be hear where but yesterday the wolf be howl . they be peaceful folk , and slow to war , but when they have set their hand to it , though they may be slack to begin , they be slack still to cease . to put into your 's hand , i would ask fifteen thousand of your good troop and twenty ship of the line . " spring impatiently from his chair , and catch up his cane . " i wish , " say he , " that you would imitate these people who seem to you to be so formidable , in their excellent habit of do thing for themselves . the matter may stand until our council . reverend father , it have strike the hour of chapel , and all else may wait until we have pay out duty to heaven . " take a missal from the hand of an attendant , he walk as fast as his very high heel would permit him , towards the door , the court form a lane through which he might pass , and then close up behind to follow him in order of precedence . whilst have be afford his court that which he have openly state to be the high of human sight of the royal young officer of the guard outside have be very busy passing on the title of the numerous applicant for admission , and exchange usually a smile or a few word of greet with them , for his frank , handsome face be a well-known one at the court . with his merry eye and his brisk bearing , he look like a man who be on good term with . indeed , he have good cause to be so , for she have use him well . three year ago he have be an unknown subaltern with and in the wild of . an exchange have bring him back to and into the regiment of , but the lucky chance of have seize the bridle of the king 's horse one winter 's day in when the creature be plunge within a few yard of a deep have do for him what ten campaign might have fail to accomplish . now as a trust officer of the king 's guard , young , gallant , and popular , his lot be indeed an enviable one . and yet , with the strange perversity of human nature , he be already surfeit with the dull if magnificent routine of the king 's household , and look back with regret to the rough and free day of his early service . even there at the royal door his mind have turn away from the passage and the group of courtier to the wild ravine and foam river of the , when suddenly his eye light upon a face which he have last see among those very scene . " ah , monsieur ! " he cry . " you can have forget me . " " what ! ! ah , it be a joy indeed to see a face from over the water ! but there be a long step between a subaltern in the and a captain in the guard . you have rise rapidly . " " yes ; and yet i may be none the happy for it . there be time when i would give it all to be dance down the in a birch canoe , or to see the red and the yellow on those once more at the fall of the leaf . " " ay , " sigh . " you know that my fortune have sink as yours have rise . i have be recall , and be in my place . but there will be a storm here which such a man as he can never stand against . with the all dance the , and behind them in to whoop them on , they will need me , and they will find me wait when they send . i will see the king now , and try if i can rouse him to play the great monarch there as well as here . have i but his power in my hand , i should change the world 's history . " " ! no treason to the captain of the guard , " cry , laugh , while the stern old soldier stride past him into the king 's presence . a gentleman very richly dress in black and silver have come up during this short conversation , and advance , as the door open , with the assure air of a man whose right be beyond dispute . , however , take a quick step forward , and bar him off from the door . " i be very sorry , monsieur , " say he , " but you be forbid the presence . " " forbid the presence ! i ? you be mad ! " he step back with gray face and stare eye , one shake hand half raise in protest , " i assure you that it be his order . " " but it be incredible . it be a mistake . " " very possibly . " " then you will let me past . " " my order leave me no discretion . " " if i could have one word with the king . " " unfortunately , monsieur , it be impossible . " " only one word . " " it really do not rest with me , monsieur . " the angry nobleman stamp his foot , and stare at the door as though he have some thought of force a passage . then turn on his heel , he hasten away down the corridor with the air of a man who have come to a decision . " there , now , " grumble to himself , as he pull at his thick dark moustache , " he be off to make some fresh mischief . i will have his sister here presently , as like as not , and a pleasant little choice between break my order and make an enemy of her for life . i will rather hold against the than the king 's door against an angry woman . by my faith , here a lady , as i fear ! ah , be praise ! it be a friend , and not a foe . , mademoiselle . " " , . " the new-comer be a tall , graceful brunette , her fresh face and sparkling black eye the bright in contrast with her plain dress . " i be on guard , you see . i can talk with you . " " i can remember have ask monsieur to talk with me . " " ah , but you must not pout in that pretty way , or else i can help talk to you , " whisper the captain . " what be this in your hand , then ? " " a note from madame to the king . you will hand it to him , will you not ? " " certainly , mademoiselle . and how be madame , your mistress ? " " oh , her director have be with her all the morning , and his talk be very , very good ; but it be also very , very sad . we be not very cheerful when monsieur have be to see us . but i forget monsieur be a huguenot , and know nothing of director . " " oh , but i do not trouble about such difference . i let the and fight it out between them . yet a man must stand by his family , you know . " " ah ! if monsieur could talk to madame a little ! she would convert him . " " i would rather talk to mademoiselle , but -- " " oh ! " there be an exclamation , a whisk of dark skirt , and the soubrette have disappear down a side passage . along the broad , lighted corridor be glide a very stately and beautiful lady , tall , graceful , and exceedingly haughty . she be richly clad in a bodice of camlet and a skirt of gray silk trim with gold and silver lace . a handkerchief of priceless point half hide and half reveal her beautiful throat , and be fasten in front by a cluster of pearl , while a rope of the same , each one worth a bourgeois ' income , be coil in and out through her luxuriant hair . the lady be past her first youth , it be true , but the magnificent curve of her queenly figure , the purity of her complexion , the brightness of her blue eye and the clear regularity of her feature enable her still to claim to be the most handsome as well as the most sharp-tongued woman in the court of . so beautiful be her bearing , the carriage of her dainty head upon her proud white neck , and the sweep of her stately walk , that the young officer 's fear be overpower in his admiration , and he find it hard , as he raise his hand in salute , to retain the firm countenance which his duty demand . " ah , it be , " say madame , with a smile which be more embarrassing to him than any frown could have be . " your humble servant , marquise . " " i be fortunate in find a friend here , for there have be some ridiculous mistake this morning . " " i be concern to hear it . " " it be about my brother , monsieur . it be almost too laughable to mention , but he be actually refuse admission to the lever . " " it be my misfortune to have to refuse him , madame . " " you , ? and by what right ? " she have draw up her superb figure , and her large blue eye be blaze with indignant astonishment . " the king 's order , madame . " " the king ! be it likely that the king would cast a public slight upon my family ? from whom have you this preposterous order ? " " direct from the king through . " " absurd ! do you think that the king would venture to exclude a through the mouth of a valet ? you have be dream , captain . " " i trust that it may prove so , madame . " " but such dream be not very fortunate to the dreamer . go , tell the king that i be here , and would have a word with him . " " impossible , madame . " " and why ? " " i have be forbid to carry a message . " " to carry any message ? " " any from you , madame . " " come , captain , you improve . it only need this insult to make the thing complete . you may carry a message to the king from any adventuress , from any decay laugh shrilly at her description of her none from , ? " " such be my order , madame . it pain me deeply to be compel to carry them out . " " you may spare your protestation , captain . you may yet find that you have every reason to be deeply pained . for the last time , do you refuse to carry my message to the king ? " " i must , madame . " " then i carry it myself . " she spring forward at the door , but he slip in front of her with outstretch arm . " for 's sake , consider yourself , madame ! " he entreat . " other eye be upon you . " " ! canaille ! " she glance at the knot of , whose sergeant have draw them off a few pace , and who stand open-eyed , stare at the scene . " i tell you that i will see the king . " " no lady have ever be at the morning lever . " " then i shall be the first . " " you will ruin me if you pass . " " and none the less , i shall do so . " the matter look serious . be a man of resource , but for once he be at his wit ' end . madame 's resolution , as it be call in her presence , or effrontery , as it be term behind her back , be proverbial . if she attempt to force her way , would he venture to use violence upon one who only yesterday have hold the fortune of the whole court in the hollow of her hand , and who , with her beauty , her wit , and her energy , might very well be in the same position ? if she pass him , then his future be ruin with the king , who never brook the small deviation from his order . on the other hand , if he thrust her back , he do that which could never be forgive , and which would entail some deadly vengeance should she return to power . it be an unpleasant dilemma . but a happy thought flash into his mind at the very moment when she , with clench hand and flash eye , be on the point of make a fresh attempt to pass him . " if madame would deign to wait , " say he soothingly , " the king will be on his way to the chapel in an instant . " " it be not yet time . " " i think the hour have just go . " " and why should i wait , like a lackey ? " " it be but a moment , madame . " " no , i shall not wait . " she take a step forward towards the door . but the guardsman 's quick ear have catch the sound of move foot from within , and he know that he be master of the situation . " i will take madame 's message , " say he . " ah , you have recover your sense ! go , tell the king that i wish to speak with him . " he must gain a little time yet . " shall i say it through the lord in wait ? " " no ; yourself . " " publicly ? " " no , no ; for his private ear . " " shall i give a reason for your request ? " " oh , you madden me ! say what i have tell you , and at once . " but the young officer 's dilemma be happily over . at that instant the double door be swing open , and appear in the opening , strut forwards on his high-heeled shoe , his stick tap , his broad skirt flap , and his courtier spread out behind him . he stop as he come out , and turn to the captain of the guard . " you have a note for me ? " " yes , sire . " the monarch slip it into the pocket of his scarlet undervest , and be advance once more when his eye fall upon madame stand very stiff and erect in the middle of the passage . a dark flush of anger shot to his brow , and he walk swiftly past her without a word ; but she turn and keep pace with him down the corridor . " i have not expect this honour , madame , " say he . " nor have i expect this insult , sire . " " an insult , madame ? you forget yourself . " " no ; it be you who have forget me , sire . " " you intrude upon me . " " i wish to hear my fate from your own lip , " she whisper . " i can bear to be strike myself , sire , even by him who have my heart . but it be hard to hear that one 's brother have be wound through the mouth of valet and huguenot soldier for no fault of his , save that his sister have love too fondly . " " it be no time to speak of such thing . " " when can i see you , then , sire ? " " in your chamber . " " at what hour ? " " at four . " " then i shall trouble your majesty no further . " she sweep him one of the graceful courtesy for which she be famous , and turn away down a side passage with triumph shine in her eye . her beauty and her spirit have never fail her yet , and now that she have the monarch 's promise of an interview she never doubt that she could do as she have do before , and win back the heart of the man , however much against the conscience of the king . have walk on to his devotion in no very charitable frame of mind , as be easily to be see from his clouded brow and compressed lip . he know his late favourite well , her impulsiveness , her audacity , her lack of all restraint when thwart or oppose . she be capable of make a hideous scandal , of turn against him that bitter tongue which have so often make him laugh at the expense of other , perhaps even of make some public exposure which would leave him the butt and gossip of . he shudder at the thought . at all cost such a catastrophe must be avert . and yet how could he cut the tie which bind them ? he have break other such bond as these ; but the gentle have shrink into a convent at the very first glance which have tell her of wane love . that be true affection . but this woman would struggle hard , fight to the bitter end , before she would quit the position which be so dear to her . she speak of her wrong . what be her wrong ? in his intense selfishness , nurture by the eternal flattery which be the very air he breathe , he could not see that the fifteen year of her life which he have absorb , or the loss of the husband whom he have supplant , give her any claim upon him . in his view he have raise her to the high position which a subject could occupy . now he be weary of her , and it be her duty to retire with resignation , nay , even with gratitude for past favour . she should have a pension , and the child should be care for . what could a reasonable woman ask for more ? and then his motive for discard her be so excellent . he turn them over in his mind as he kneel listen to the archbishop of recite the , and the more he think , the more he approve . his conception of the deity be as a large , and of heaven as a more gorgeous . if he exact obedience from his twenty million , then he must show it also to this one who have a right to demand it of him . on the whole , his conscience acquit him . but in this one matter he have be lax . from the first come of his gentle and forgiving young wife from , he have never once permit her to be without a rival . now that she be dead , the matter be no good . one favourite have succeed another , and if have hold her own so long , it be rather from her audacity than from his affection . but now and be ever remind him that he have top the summit of his life , and be already upon that downward path which lead to the grave . his wild outburst over the unhappy have represent the last flicker of his passion . the time have come for gravity and for calm , neither of which be to be expect in the company of madame . but he have find out where they be to be enjoy . from the day when have introduce the stately and silent widow as a governess for his child , he have find a and ever-increase pleasure in her society . in the early day of her come he have sit for hour in the room of his favourite , watch the tact and sweetness of temper with which her dependent control the mutinous spirit of the petulant young and the mischievous little . he have be there nominally for the purpose of superintend the teaching , but he have confine himself to admire the teacher . and then in time he too have be draw into the attraction of that strong sweet nature , and have find himself consult her upon point of conduct , and act upon her advice with a docility which he have never show before to minister or mistress . for a time he have think that her piety and her talk of principle might be a mere mask , for he be accustom to hypocrisy all round him . it be surely unlikely that a woman who be still beautiful , with as bright an eye and as graceful a figure as any in his court , could , after a life spend in the gay circle , preserve the spirit of a nun . but on this point he be soon undeceive , for when his own language have become warm than that of friendship , he have be meet by an iciness of manner and a brevity of speech which have show him that there be one woman at least in his dominions who have a high respect for herself than for him . and perhaps it be well so . the placid pleasure of friendship be very soothing after the storm of passion . to sit in her room every afternoon , to listen to talk which be not taint with flattery , and to hear opinion which be not frame to please his ear , be the occupation now of his happy hour . and then her influence over him be all so good ! she speak of his kingly duty , of his example to his subject , of his preparation for the world beyond , and of the need for an effort to snap the guilty ty which he have form . she be as good as a confessor with a lovely face and a perfect arm . and now he know that the time have come when he must choose between her and . their influence be antagonistic . they could not continue together . he stand between virtue and vice , and he must choose . be very attractive too , very comely , very witty , and hold him by that chain of custom which be so hard to shake off . there be hour when his nature sway strongly over to that side , and when he be tempt to fall back into his old life . but and be ever at his elbow to whisper encouragement , and , above all , there be madame to remind him of what be due to his position and to his year . now at last he have brace himself for a supreme effort . there be no safety for him while his old favourite be at court . he know himself too well to have any faith in a lasting change so long as she be there ever wait for his moment of weakness . she must be persuade to leave , if without a scandal it could be do . he would be firm when he meet her in the afternoon , and make her understand once for all that her reign be forever over . such be the thought which run through the king 's head as he bend over the rich crimson cushion which top his prie-dieu of carve oak . he kneel in his own enclosure to the right of the altar , with his guard and his immediate household around him , while the court , lady and cavalier , fill the chapel . piety be a fashion now , like dark overcoat and lace cravat , and no courtier be so as not to have have a touch of grace since the king have take to religion . yet they look very bore , these soldier and seigneur , yawn and blink over the missal , while some who seem more intent upon their devotion be really dip into the late romance of or , cunningly bind up in a sombre cover . the lady , indeed , be more devout , and be determine that all should see it , for each have light a tiny taper , which she hold in front of her on the plea of light up her missal , but really that her face might be visible to the king , and inform him that hers be a kindred spirit . a few there may have be , here and there , whose prayer rise from their heart , and who be there of their own free will ; but the policy of have change his nobleman into courtier and his man of the world into hypocrite , until the whole court be like one gigantic mirror which reflect his own likeness a hundredfold . it be the habit of , as he walk back from the chapel , to receive petition or to listen to any tale of wrong which his subject might bring to him . his way , as he return to his room , lie partly across an open space , and here it be that the suppliant be wont to assemble . on this particular morning there be but two or , who conceive himself injure by the provost of his guild , a peasant whose cow have be tear by a huntsman 's dog , and a farmer who have have hard usage from his feudal lord . a few question and then a hurried order to his secretary dispose of each case , for if be a tyrant himself , he have at least the merit that he insist upon be the only one within his kingdom . he be about to resume his way again , when an elderly man , clad in the garb of a respectable citizen , and with a strong face which mark him as a man of character , dart forward , and throw himself down upon one knee in front of the monarch . " , sire , justice ! " he cry . " what be this , then ? " ask . " who be you , and what be it that you want ? " " i be a citizen of , and i have be cruelly wrong . " " you seem a very worthy person . if you have indeed be wrong you shall have redress . what have you to complain of ? " " twenty of the of be quarter in my house , with at their head . they have devour my food , steal my property , and beat my servant , yet the magistrate will give me no redress . ' " on my life , justice seem to be administer in a strange fashion in our city of ! " exclaim the king wrathfully . " it be indeed a shameful case , " say . " and yet there may be a very good reason for it , " suggest . " i would suggest that your majesty should ask this man his name , his business , and why it be that the dragoon be quarter upon him . " " you hear the reverend father 's question . " " my name , sire , be , by trade i be a merchant in cloth , and i be treat in this fashion because i be of the reformed church . " " i think as much ! " cry the confessor . " that alter matter , " say . the king shake his head and his brow darken . " you have only yourself to thank , then . the remedy be in your hand . " " and how , sire ? " " by embrace the only true faith . " " i be already a member of it , sire . " the king stamp his foot angrily . " i can see that you be a very insolent heretic , " say he . " there be but one church in , and that be my church . if you be outside that , you can look to me for aid . " " my creed be that of my father , sire , and of my grandfather . " " if they have sin it be no reason why you should . my own grandfather err also before his eye be open . " " but he nobly atone for his error , " murmur the jesuit . " then you will not help me , sire ? " " you must first help yourself . " the old huguenot stand up with a gesture of despair , while the king continue on his way , the two ecclesiastic , on either side of him , murmur their approval into his ear . " you have do nobly , sire . " " you be truly the first son of the church . " " you be the worthy successor of . " but the king bear the face of a man who be not absolutely satisfy with his own action . " you do not think , then , that these people have too hard a measure ? " say he . " too hard ? nay , your majesty err on the side of mercy . " " i hear that they be leave my kingdom in great number . " " and surely it be well so , sire ; for what blessing can come upon a country which have such stubborn infidel within its boundary ? " " those who be traitor to can scarce be loyal to the king , " remark . " your 's power would be great if there be no temple , as they call their den of heresy , within your dominions . " " my grandfather promise them protection . they be shield , as you well know , by the edict which be give at . " " but it lie with your majesty to undo the mischief that have be do . " " and how ? " " by recall the edict . " " and drive into the open arm of my enemy two million of my good artisan and of my brave servant . no , no , father , i have , i trust , every zeal for , but there be some truth in what say this morning of the evil which come from mix the affair of this world with those of the next . how say you , ? " " with all respect to the , sire , i would say that the devil have give these man such cunning of hand and of brain that they be the good worker and trader in your 's kingdom . i know not how the state coffer be to be fill if such tax-payer go from among us . already many have leave the country and take their trade with them . if all be to go , it would be bad for us than a lose campaign . " " but , " remark , " if it be once know that the king 's will have be express , your majesty may rest assured that even the bad of his subject bear him such love that they would hasten to come within the pale of . as long as the edict stand , it seem to them that the king be lukewarm , and that they may abide in their error . " the king shake his head . " they have always be stubborn folk , " say he . " perhaps , " remark , glance maliciously at , " be the bishop of to make an offering to the state of the treasure of their see , we might then do without these huguenot taxis . " " all that the have be at the king 's service , " answer curtly . " the kingdom be mine and all that be in it , " remark , as they enter the , in which the court assemble after chapel , " yet i trust that it may be long before i have to claim the wealth of the church . " " we trust so , sire , " echo the ecclesiastic . " but we may reserve such topic for our council-chamber . where be ? i must see his plan for the new wing at . " he cross to a side table , and be bury in an instant in his favourite pursuit , inspect the gigantic plan of the great architect , and inquire eagerly as to the progress of the work . " i think , " say , draw aside , " that your grace have make some impression upon the king 's mind . " " with your powerful assistance , father . " " oh , you may rest assured that i shall lose no opportunity of push on the good work . " " if you take it in hand , it be do . " " but there be another who have more weight than " " the favourite , ? " " no , no ; her day be go . it be madame . " " i hear that she be very devout . " " very . but she have no love for my order . she be a . yet we may all work to one end . now if you be to speak to her , your grace . " " with all my heart . " " show her how good a service it would be could she bring about the banishment of the huguenot . " " i shall do so . " " and offer her in return that we will -- " he bend forward and whisper into the prelate 's ear . " what ! he would not do it ! " " and why ? the queen be dead . " " the widow of the poet ! " " she be of good birth . her grandfather and his be dear friend . " " it be impossible . " " but i know his heart , and i say it be possible . " " you certainly know his heart , father , if any can . but such a thought have never enter my head . " " then let it enter and remain there . if she will serve the , the will serve her . but the king beckon , and i must go . " the thin dark figure hasten off through the throng of courtier , and the great of remain stand with his chin upon his breast , sink in reflection . by this time all the court be assemble in the , and the huge room be gay from end to end with the silk , the velvet , and the brocade of the lady , the glitter of jewel , the flirt of painted fan , and the sweep of plume or aigrette . the gray , black , and brown of the man 's coat tone down the mass of colour , for all must be dark when the king be dark , and only the blue of the officer ' uniform , and the pearl and gray of the musketeer of the guard , remain to call back those early day of the reign when the man have vie with the woman in the costliness and brilliancy of their wardrobe . and if dress have change , manner have do so even more . the old levity and the old passion lie doubtless very near the surface , but grave face and serious talk be the fashion of the hour . it be no long the lucky coup at the lansquenet table , the last comedy of , or the new opera of about which they gossip , but it be on the evil of , on the expulsion of from the , on the insolence of , or on the comparative merit of two such popular preacher as and . so , under a radiant ceiling and over a floor , surround by immortal painting , set thickly in gold and ornament , there move these noble and lady of , all mould themselves upon the one little dark figure in their midst , who be himself so far from be his own master that he hang balance even now between two rival woman , who be play a game in which the future of and his own destiny be the stake . the elderly huguenot have stand silent after his repulse by the king , with his eye cast moodily downwards , and a face in which doubt , sorrow , and anger contend for the mastery . he be a very large , gaunt man , raw-boned and haggard , with a wide forehead , a large , fleshy nose , and a powerful chin . he wear neither wig nor powder , but have put her own silver upon his thick grizzled lock , and the thousand pucker which cluster round the edge of his eye , or draw at the corner of his mouth , give a set gravity to his face which need no device of the barber to increase it . yet in spite of his mature year , the swift anger with which he have spring up when the king refuse his plaint , and the keen fiery glance which he have shoot at the royal court as they file past him with many a scornful smile and whisper gibe at his expense , all show that he have still preserve something of the strength and of the spirit of his youth . he be dress as become his rank , plainly and yet well , in a brown kersey coat with silver-plate button , knee-breeches of the same , and white woollen stocking , end in black leather shoe cut across with a great steel buckle . in one hand he carry his low feel hat , trim with gold edging , and in the other a little cylinder of paper contain a recital of his wrong , which he have hope to leave in the hand of the king 's secretary . his doubt as to what his next step should be be soon resolve for him in a very summary fashion . these be day when , if the huguenot be not absolutely forbid in , he be at least look upon as a man who exist upon sufferance , and who be by the law which protect his catholic . for twenty year the stringency of the persecution have increase until there be no weapon which bigotry could employ , short of absolute expulsion , which have not be turn against him . he be impede in his business , elbow out of all public employment , his house fill with troop , his child encourage to rebel against him , and all redress refuse him for the insult and assault to which he be subject . every rascal who wish to gratify his personal spite , or to gain favour with his bigoted superior , might do his bad upon him without fear of the law . yet , in spite of all , these man cling to the land which disown them , and , full of the love for their native soil which lie so deep in a frenchman 's heart , preferred insult and contumely at home to the welcome which would await them beyond the sea . already , however , the shadow of those day be fall upon them when the choice should no longer be theirs . two of the king 's big guardsman be on duty at that side of the palace , and have be witness to his unsuccessful appeal . now they tramp across together to where he be stand , and break brutally into the current of his thought . " now , , " say one gruffly , " get off again about your business . " " you be not a very pretty ornament to the king 's pathway , " cry the other , with a hideous oath . " who be you , to turn up your nose at the king 's religion , curse you ? " the old huguenot shoot a glance of anger and contempt at them , and be turn to go , when one of them thrust at his rib with the butt end of his halberd . " take that , you dog ! " he cry . " would you dare to look like that at the king 's guard ? " " child of , " cry the old man , with his hand press to his side , " be i twenty year young you would not have dare to use me so . " " ! you would still spit your venom , would you ? that be enough , ! he have threaten the king 's guard . let us seize him and drag him to the . " the two soldier drop their halberd and rush upon the old man , but , tall and strong as they be , they find it no easy matter to secure him . with his long sinewy arm and his wiry frame , he shake himself clear of them again and again , and it be only when his breath have fail him that the two , tear and pant , be able to twist round his wrist , and so secure him . they have hardly win their pitiful victory , however , before a stern voice and a sword flash before their eye , compel them to release their prisoner once more . it be , who , his morning duty over , have stroll out on to the terrace , and have come upon this sudden scene of outrage . at the sight of the old man 's face he give a violent start , and draw his sword , have rush forward with such fury that the two guardsman not only drop their victim , but , stagger back from the threatening , one of them slip and the other roll over him , a revolving mass of blue coat and white kersey . " villain ! " roar . " what be the meaning of this ? " the two have stumble on to their foot again , very shamefaced and ruffle . " if you please , captain , " say one , salute , " this be a huguenot who abuse the royal guard . " " his petition have be reject by the king , captain , and yet he refuse to go . " be white with fury . " and so , when a french citizen have come to have a word with the great master of his country , he must be harass by two swiss dog like you ? " he cry . " by my faith , we shall soon see about that ! " he draw a little silver whistle from his pocket , and at the shrill summons an old sergeant and half a dozen soldier come run from the . " your name ? " ask the captain sternly . " . " " and yours ? " " . " " sergeant , you will arrest these man , and . " " certainly , captain , " say the sergeant , a dark grizzled old soldier of and . " see that they be try . " " and on what charge , captain ? " " for assault an age and respect citizen who have come on business to the king . " " he be a huguenot on his own confession , " cry the culprit together . " hum ! " the sergeant pull doubtfully at his long moustache . " shall we put the charge in that form , captain ? just as the captain please . " he give a little shrug of his shoulder to signify his doubt whether any good could arise from it . " no , " say , with a sudden happy thought . " i charge them with lay their halberd down while on duty , and with have their uniform dirty and disarrange . " " that be good , " answer the sergeant , with the freedom of a privileged veteran . " thunder of , but you have disgrace the guard ! an hour on the wooden horse with a musket at either foot may teach you that halberd be make for a soldier 's hand , and not for the king 's . seize them ! attention ! right half turn ! ! " and away go the little clump of guardsman with the sergeant in the rear . the huguenot have stand in the background , grave and compose , without any sign of exultation , during this sudden reversal of fortune ; but when the soldier be go , he and the young officer turn warmly upon each other . " , i have not hope to see you ! " " nor i you , uncle . what , in the name of wonder , bring you to ? " " my wrong , . the hand of the wicked be heavy upon us , and whom can we turn to save only the king ? " the young officer shake his head . " the king be at heart a good man , " say he . " but he can only see the world through the glass which be hold before him . you have nothing to hope from him . " " he spurn me from his presence . " " do he ask your name ? " " he do , and i give it . " the young guardsman whistle . " let us walk to the gate , " say he . " by my faith , if my kinsman be to come and bandy argument with the king , it may not be long before my company find itself without its captain . " " the king would not couple us together . but indeed , nephew , it be strange to me how you can live in this house of and yet bow down to no false god . " " i keep my belief in my own heart . " the old man shake his head gravely . " your way lie along a very narrow path , " say he , " with temptation and danger ever at your foot . it be hard for you to walk with the , , and yet go hand in hand with the persecutor of his people . " " tut , uncle ! " say the young man impatiently . " i be a soldier of the king 's , and i be willing to let the black gown and the white surplice settle these matter between them . let me live in honour and die in my duty , and i be content to wait to know the rest . " " content , too , to live in palace , and eat from fine linen , " say the huguenot bitterly , " when the hand of the wicked be heavy upon your kinsfolk , and there be a breaking of phial , and a pour forth of tribulation , and a wail and a weep throughout the land . " " what be amiss , then ? " ask the young soldier , who be somewhat mystify by the scriptural language in use among the french calvinist of the day . " twenty man of have be quarter upon me , with one , their captain , who have long be a scourge to . " " , of the ? i have already some small score to settle with him . " " ay , and the scattered remnant have also a score against this murderous dog and self-seeking . " " what have he do , then ? " " his man be over my house like moth in a cloth bale . no place be free from them . he sit in the room which should be mine , his great boot on my spanish leather chair , his pipe in his mouth , his at his elbow , and his talk a hiss and an abomination . he have beat old of the warehouse . " " ! " " and thrust me into the cellar . " " ! " " because i have drag him back when in his drunken love he would have throw his arm about your cousin . " " oh ! " the young man 's colour have be rise and his brow knit at each successive charge , but at this last his anger boil over , and he hurry forward with fury in his face , drag his elderly companion by the elbow . they have be pass through one of those wind path , border by high hedge , which thin away every here and there to give a glimpse of some prowl faun or weary nymph who slumber in marble amid the foliage . the few courtier who meet them gaze with surprise at so ill-assorted a pair of companion . but the young soldier be too full of his own plan to waste a thought upon their speculation . still hurry on , he follow a crescent path which lead past a dozen stone dolphin shoot water out of their mouth over a group of , and so through an avenue of great tree which look as if they have grow there for century , and yet have in truth be carry over that very year by incredible labour from and . beyond this point a small gate lead out of the ground , and it be through it that the two pass , the elder man puff and pant with this unusual haste . " how do you come , uncle ? " " in a caleche . " " where be it ? " " that be it , beyond the auberge . " " come , let us make for it . " " and you , , be you come ? " " my faith , it be time that i come , from what you tell me . there be room for a man with a sword at his side in this establishment of yours . " " but what would you do ? " " i would have a word with this . " " then i have wrong you , nephew , when i say even now that you be not whole-hearted towards . " " i know not about , " cry impatiently . " i only know that if my choose to worship the thunder like an squaw , or turn her innocent prayer to the , i should like to set eye upon the man who would dare to lay a hand upon her . , here come our caleche ! up , driver , and five livre to you if you pass the gate of the within the hour . " it be no light matter to drive fast in an age of springless carriage and deeply rut road , but the driver lash at his two rough horse , and the caleche jolt and clatter upon its way . as they speed on , with the tree dance past the narrow window , and the white dust stream behind them , the guardsman drum his finger upon his knee , and fidget in his seat with impatience , shoot an occasional question across at his grim companion . " when be all this , then ? " " it be yesterday night . " " and where be now ? " " she be at home . " " and this ? " " oh , he be there also ! " " what ! you have leave her in his power while you come away to ? " " she be lock in her room . " " ! what be a lock ? " the young man rave with his hand in the air at the thought of his own impotence . " and be there ? " " he be useless . " " and . " " ah , that be good . he be a man , by the look of him . " " his mother be one of our own folk from , near . she be one of those scattered lamb who flee early before the wolf , when first it be see that the king 's hand wax heavy upon . he speak french , and yet he be neither french to the eye , nor be his way like our way . " " he have choose an evil time for his visit . " " some wise purpose may lie hide in it . " " and you have leave him in the house ? " " yes ; he be sit with this , smoking with him , and tell him strange tale . " " what guard could he be ? he be a stranger in a strange land . you do ill to leave thus , uncle . " " she be in 's hand , . " " i trust so . oh , i be on fire to be there ! " he thrust his head through the cloud of dust which rise from the wheel , and crane his neck to look upon the long curve river and city , which be already visible before them , half hide by a thin blue haze , through which shoot the double tower of , with the high spire of and a forest of other steeple and minaret , the monument of eight hundred year of devotion . soon , as the road curve down to the river-bank , the city wall grow near and near , until they have pass the southern gate , and be rattle over the stony causeway , leave the broad upon their right , and 's last work , the , upon their left . a sharp turn bring them on to the river quay , and cross over the , they skirt the stately , and plunge into the labyrinth of narrow but important street which extend to the northward . the young officer have his head still thrust out of the window , but his view be obscure by a broad gilded carriage which lumber heavily along in front of them . as the road broaden , however , it swerve to one side , and he be able to catch a glimpse of the house to which they be make . it be surround on every side by an immense crowd . the house of the huguenot merchant be a tall , narrow building standing at the corner of the and the . it be four storey in height , grim and grave like its owner , with high peaked roof , long window , a of black wood , with gray plaster fill the interstice , and five stone step which lead up to the narrow and sombre door . the upper story be but a warehouse in which the trader keep his stock , but the second and third be furnish with balcony edge with stout wooden balustrade . as the uncle and the nephew spring out of the caleche , they find themselves upon the outskirt of a dense crowd of people , who be sway and toss with excitement , their chin all throw forwards and their gaze direct upwards . follow their eye , the young officer see a sight which leave him stand bereft of every sensation save amazement . from the upper balcony there be hang head downwards a man clad in the bright blue coat and white breech of one of the king 's dragoon . his hat and wig have drop off , and his close-cropped head swing slowly backwards and forwards a good fifty foot above the pavement . his face be turn towards the street , and be of a deadly whiteness , while his eye be screw up as though he dare not open them upon the horror which face them . his voice , however , resound over the whole place until the air be fill with his scream for mercy . above him , at the corner of the balcony , there stand a young man who lean with a bent back over the balustrade , and who hold the dangling dragoon by either ankle . his face , however , be not direct towards his victim , but be half turn over his shoulder to confront a group of soldier who be cluster at the long , open window which lead out into the balcony . his head , as he glance at them , be poise with a proud air of defiance , while they surge and oscillate in the opening , uncertain whether to rush on or to retire . suddenly the crowd give a groan of excitement . the young man have release his grip upon one of the ankle , and the dragoon hang now by one only , his other leg flap helplessly in the air . he grab aimlessly with his hand at the wall and the behind him , still yell at the pitch of his lung . " pull me up , son of the devil , pull me up ! " he scream . " would you murder me , then ? help , good people , help ! " " do you want to come up , captain ? " say the strong clear voice of the young man above him , speak excellent french , but in an accent which fall strangely upon the ear of the crowd beneath . " yes , sacred name of , yes ! " " order off your man , then . " " away , you dolt , you imbecile ! do you wish to see me dash to piece ? away , i say ! off with you ! " " that be good , " say the youth , when the soldier have vanish from the window . he give a tug at the dragoon 's leg as he speak , which jerk him up so far that he could twist round and catch hold of the low edge of the balcony . " how do you find yourself now ? " he ask . " hold me , for heaven 's sake , hold me ! " " i have you quite secure . " " then pull me up ! " " not so fast , captain . you can talk very well where you be . " " let me up , sir , let me up ! " " all in good time . i fear that it be inconvenient to you to talk with your heel in the air . " " ah , you would murder me ! " " on the contrary , i be go to pull you up . " " heaven bless you ! " " but only on condition . " " oh , they be grant ! i be slip ! " " you will leave this and your man . you will not trouble this old man or this young girl any further . do you promise ? " " oh yes ; we shall go . " " word of honour ? " " certainly . only pull me up ! " " not so fast . it may be easy to talk to you like this . i do not know how the law be over here . maybe this sort of thing be not permit . you will promise me that i shall have no trouble over the matter . " " none , none . only pull me up ! " " very good . come along ! " he drag at the dragoon 's leg while the other grip his way up the balustrade until , amid a buzz of congratulation from the crowd , he tumble all in a heap over the rail on to the balcony , where he lie for a few moment as he have fall . then staggering to his foot , without a glance at his opponent , he rush , with a bellow of rage , through the open window . while this little drama have be enact overhead , the young guardsman have shake off his first stupor of amazement , and have push his way through the crowd with such vigour that he and his companion have nearly reach the bottom of the step . the uniform of the king 's guard be in itself a passport anywhere , and the face of old be so well know in the district that everyone draw back to clear a path for him towards his house . the door be fling open for them , and an old servant stand wring his hand in the dark passage . " oh , master ! oh , master ! " he cry . " such doing , such infamy ! they will murder him ! " " whom , then ? " " this brave monsieur from . oh , my , hark to them now ! " as he speak , a clatter and shouting which have burst out again upstairs end suddenly in a tremendous crash , with volley of oath and a prolonged bump and smash , which shake the old house to its foundation . the soldier and the huguenot rush swiftly up the first flight of stair , and be about to ascend the second one , from the head of which the uproar seem to proceed , when a great eight-day clock come hurtle down , spring four step at a time , and end with a leap across the landing and a crash against the wall , which leave it a shattered heap of metal wheel and wooden splinter . an instant afterwards four man , so lock together that they form but one rolling bundle , come thud down amid a debris of splinter , and writhe and struggle upon the landing , stagger up , fall down , and all breathing together like the wind in a chimney . so twist and twine be they that it be hard to pick one from the other , save that the innermost be clad in black flemish cloth , while the three who cling to him be soldier of the king . yet so strong and vigorous be the man whom they try to hold that as often as he could find his foot he drag them after him from end to end of the passage , as a boar might pull the cur which have fasten on to his haunch . an officer , who have rush down at the heel of the brawler , thrust his hand in to catch the civilian by the throat , but he whip them back again with an oath as the man 's strong white tooth meet in his left thumb . clap the wound to his mouth , he flash out his sword and be about to drive it through the body of his unarmed opponent , when spring forward and catch him by the wrist . " you villain , ! " he cry . the sudden appearance of one of the king 's own bodyguard have a magic effect upon the brawler . spring back , with his thumb still in his mouth , and his sword droop , scowl darkly at the new-comer . his long sallow face be distort with anger , and his small black eye blaze with passion and with the light of unsatisfied vengeance . his trooper have release their victim , and stand pant in a line , while the young man lean against the wall , brush the dust from his black coat , and look from his rescuer to his antagonist . " i have a little account to settle with you before , , " say , unsheathe his rapier . " i be on the king 's errand , " snarl the other . " no doubt . on guard , sir ! " " i be here on duty , i tell you ! " " very good . your sword , sir ! " " i have no quarrel with you . " " no ? " step forward and strike him across the face with his open hand . " it seem to me that you have one now , " say he . " hell and fury ! " scream the captain . " to your arm , man ! , there , from above ! cut down this fellow , and seize your prisoner ! ! in the king 's name ! " at his call a dozen more trooper come hurry down the stair , while the three upon the landing advance upon their former antagonist . he slip by them , however , and catch out of the old merchant 's hand the thick oak stick which he carry . " i be with you , sir , " say he , take his place beside the guardsman . " call off your canaille , and fight me like a gentleman , " cry . " a gentleman ! hark to the bourgeois huguenot , whose family peddle cloth ! " " you coward ! i will write liar on you with my ! " he spring forward , and send in a thrust which might have find its way to 's heart have the heavy sabre of a dragoon not descend from the side and shear his more delicate weapon short off close to the hilt . with a shout of triumph , his enemy spring furiously upon him with his rapier shorten , but be meet by a sharp blow from the cudgel of the young stranger which send his weapon tinkle on to the ground . a trooper , however , on the stair have pull out a pistol , and clap it within a foot of the guardsman 's head , be about to settle the combat , once and forever , when a little old gentleman , who have quietly ascend from the street , and who have be look on with an amused and interested smile at this fiery sequence of event , take a sudden step forward , and order all party to drop their weapon with a voice so decide , so stern , and so full of authority , that the sabre point all clink down together upon the parquet flooring as though it be a part of their daily drill . " upon my word , gentleman , upon my word ! " say he , look sternly from one to the other . he be a very small , dapper man , as thin as a herring , with project tooth and a huge droop wig , which cut off the line of his skinny neck and the slope of his narrow shoulder . his dress be a long overcoat of velvet slash with gold , beneath which be high leather boot , which , with his little , three-cornered hat , give a military tinge to his appearance . in his gait and bear he have a dainty strut and backward cock of the head , which , take with his sharp black eye , his high thin feature , and his assured manner , would impress a stranger with the feeling that this be a man of power . and , indeed , in or out of it there be few to whom this man 's name be not familiar , for in all the only figure which loom up as large as that of the king be this very little gentleman who stand now , with gold snuff-box in one hand , and handkerchief in the other , upon the landing of the huguenot 's house . for who be there who do not know the last of the great french noble , the brave of french captain , the beloved , victor of and hero of the ? at the sight of his pinch , sallow face the dragoon and their leader have stand stare , while raise the stump of his sword in a salute . " , ! " cry the old soldier , peer at him . " you be with me on the ? i know your face , captain . but the household be with . " " i be in the regiment of , your highness . be my name . " " yes , yes . but you , sir , who the devil be you ? " " , your highness , of the . " " ! i be pass in my carriage , and i see you stand on your head in the air . the young man let you up on condition , as i understand . " " he swear he would go from the house , " cry the young stranger . " yet when i have let him up , he set his man upon me , and we all come downstairs together . " " my faith , you seem to have leave little behind you , " say , smile , as he glance at the litter which be strew all over the floor . " and so you break your parole , ? " " i could not hold treaty with a huguenot and an enemy of the king , " say the dragoon sulkily . " you could hold treaty , it appear , but not keep it . and why do you let him go , sir , when you have him at such a vantage ? " " i believe his promise . " " you must be of a trusting nature . " " i have be use to deal with . " " ! and you think an 's word be good than that of an officer in the king 's dragoon ? " " i do not think so an hour ago . " " hem ! " take a large pinch of snuff , and brush the wander grain from his velvet coat with his handkerchief of point . " you be very strong , monsieur , " say he , glance keenly at the broad shoulder and arch chest of the young stranger . " you be from , i presume ? " " i have be there , sir . but i be from . " shake his head . " an island ? " " no , sir ; a town . " " in what province ? " " the province of . " " the chief town , then ? " " ; be the chief town . " " and how come you to speak french ? " " my mother be of french blood . " " and how long have you be in ? " " a day . " " ! and you already begin to throw your mother 's out of window ! " " he be annoy a young maid , sir , and i ask him to stop , whereon he whip out his sword , and would have slay me have i not close with him , upon which he call upon his fellow to aid him . to keep them off , i swear that i would drop him over if they move a step . yet when i let him go , they set upon me again , and i know not what the end might have be have this gentleman not stand my friend . " " hem ! you do very well . you be young , but you have resource . " " i be rear in the wood , sir . " " if there be many of your kidney , you may give my friend some work ere he find this empire of which he talk . but how be this , ? what have you to say ? " " the king 's order , your highness . " " ! do he order you to molest the girl ? i have never yet hear that his majesty err by be too harsh with a woman . " he give a little dry chuckle in his throat , and take another pinch of snuff . " the order be , your highness , to use every means which may drive these people into the true church . " " on my word , you look a very fine apostle and a pretty champion for a holy cause , " say , glance sardonically out of his twinkle black eye at the brutal face of the dragoon . " take your man out of this , sir , and never venture to set your foot again across this threshold . " " but the king 's command , your highness . " " i will tell the king when i see him that i leave soldier and that i find brigand . not a word , sir ! away ! you take your shame with you , and you leave your honour behind . " he have turn in an instant from the sneering , strut old beau to the fierce soldier with set face and eye of fire . shrink back from his baleful gaze , and mutter an order to his man , they file off down the stair with clatter foot and clank of sabre . " your highness , " say the old huguenot , come forward and throw open one of the door which lead from the landing , " you have indeed be a saviour of and a stumbling-block to the froward this day . will you not deign to rest under my roof , and even to take a cup of wine ere you go onwards ? " raise his thick eyebrow at the scriptural fashion of the merchant 's speech , but he bow courteously to the invitation , and enter the chamber , look around him in surprise and admiration at its magnificence . with its panelling of dark shine oak , its polished floor , its stately marble , and its beautifully mould ceiling , it be indeed a room which might have grace a palace . " my carriage wait below , " say he , " and i must not delay longer . it be not often that i leave my castle of chantilly to come to , and it be a fortunate chance which make me pass in time to be of service to honest man . when a house hang out such a sign as an officer of dragoon with his heel in the air , it be hard to drive past without a question . but i fear that as long as you be a huguenot , there will be no peace for you in , monsieur . " " the law be indeed heavy upon us . " " and will be heavy if what i hear from court be correct . i wonder that you do not fly the country . " " my business and my duty lie here . " " well , every man know his own affair well . would it not be wise to bend to the storm , ? " the huguenot give a gesture of horror . " well , well , i mean no harm . and where be this fair maid who have be the cause of the broil ? " " where be , ? " ask the merchant of the old servant , who have carry in the silver tray with a squat flask and tint venetian glass . " i lock her in my room , master . " " and where be she now ? " " i be here , father . " the young girl spring into the room , and throw her arm round the old merchant 's neck . " oh , i trust these wicked man have not hurt you , love ! " " no , no , dear child ; none of us have be hurt , thank to his highness the of here . " raise her eye , and quickly droop them again before the keen questioning gaze of the old soldier . " reward your highness ! " she stammer . in her confusion the blood rush to her face , which be perfect in feature and expression . with her sweet delicate contour , her large gray eye , and the sweep of the lustrous hair , set off with its rich tint the little ear and the alabaster whiteness of the neck and throat , even , who have see all the beauty of three court and of sixty year defile before him , stand stare in admiration at the huguenot maiden . " ! on my word , mademoiselle , you make me wish that i could wipe forty year from my account . " he bow , and sigh in the fashion that be in vogue when come to the wooing of of , and the dynasty of cardinal be at its height . " could ill spare those forty year , your highness . " " , ! so quick of tongue too ? your daughter have a courtly wit , monsieur . " " forbid , your highness ! she be as pure and -- " " , that be but a sorry compliment to the court . surely , mademoiselle , you would love to go out into the great world , to hear sweet music , see all that be lovely , and wear all that be costly , rather than look out ever upon the , and bide in this great dark house until the rose wither upon your cheek . " " where my father be , i be happy at his side , " say she , put her two hand upon his sleeve . " i ask nothing more than i have get . " " and i think it best that you go up to your room again , " say the old merchant shortly , for the prince , in spite of his age , bear an evil name among woman . he have come close to her as he speak , and have even place one yellow hand upon her shrink arm , while his little dark eye twinkle with an ominous light . " tut , tut ! " say he , as she hasten to obey . " you need not fear for your little dove . this hawk , at least , be far past the stoop , however tempt the quarry . but indeed , i can see that she be as good as she be fair , and one could not say more than that if she be from heaven direct . my carriage wait , gentleman , and i wish you all a very good day ! " he incline his head , and strut off in his dainty , dandify fashion . from the window could see him slip into the same gilded chariot which have stand in his way as he drive from . " by my faith , " say he , turn to the young american , " we all owe thank to the prince , but it seem to me , sir , that we be your debtor even more . you have risk your life for my cousin , and but for your cudgel , would have have his blade through me when he have me at a vantage . your hand , sir ! these be thing which a man can forget . " " ay , you may well thank him , , " break in the old huguenot , who have return after escort his illustrious guest to the carriage . " he have be raise up as a champion for the afflict , and as a helper for those who be in need . an old man 's blessing upon you , , for my own son could not have do for me more than you , a stranger . " but their young visitor appear to be more embarrassed by their thank than by any of his preceding adventure . the blood flush to his , clear-cut face , as smooth as that of a boy , and yet mark by a firmness of lip and a shrewdness in the keen blue eye which speak of a strong and self-reliant nature . " i have a mother and two sister over the water , " say he diffidently . " and you honour woman for their sake ? " " we always honour woman over there . perhaps it be that we have so few . over in these old country you have not learn what it be to be without them . i have be away up the lake for fur , live for month on end the life of a savage among the wigwam of the and the , foul liver and foul talker , ever squat like toad around their fire . then when i have come back to where my folk then dwell , and have hear my sister play upon the spinet and sing , and my mother talk to us of the of her young day and of her childhood , and of all that they have suffer for what they think be right , then i have feel what a good woman be , and how , like the sunshine , she draw out of one 's soul all that be pure and good . " " indeed , the lady should be very much oblige to monsieur , who be as eloquent as he be brave , " say , who , stand in the open door , have listen to the latter part of his remark . he have forget himself for the instant , and have speak freely and with energy . at the sight of the girl , however , he colour up again , and cast down his eye . " much of my life have be spend in the wood , " say he , " and one speak so little there that one come to forget how to do it . it be for this that my father wish me to stay some time in , for he would not have me grow up a mere trapper and trader . " " and how long do you stop in ? " ask the guardsman . " until come for me . " " and who be he ? " " the master of the . " " and that be your ship ? " " my father 's ship . she have be to , be now at , and then must go to again . when she come back once more , come to for me , and it will be time for me to go . " " and how like you ? " the young man smile . " they tell me ere i come that it be a very lively place , and truly from the little that i have see this morning , i think that it be the lively place that i have see . " " by my faith , " say , " you come down those stair in a very lively fashion , four of you together with a dutch clock as an , and a whole train of at your heel . and you have not see the city yet ? " " only as i journey through it on my way to this house . it be a wondrous place , but i be pen in for lack of air as i pass through it . be a great city . there be say to be as many as three thousand folk living there , and they say that they could send out four hundred , though i can scarce bring myself to believe it . yet from all part of the city one may see something of 's tree , the green of the grass , and the shine of the sun upon the bay and the river . but here it be stone and wood , and wood and stone , look where you will . in truth , you must be very hardy people to keep your health in such a place . " " and to us it be you who seem so hardy , with your life in the forest and on the river , " cry the young girl . " and then the wonder that you can find your path through those great wilderness , where there be naught to guide you . " " well , there again ! i marvel how you can find your way among these thousand of house . for myself , i trust that it will be a clear night . " " and why ? " " that i may see the star . " " but you will find no change in them . " " that be it . if i can but see the star , it will be easy for me to know how to walk when i would find this house again . in the daytime i can carry a knife and notch the door-post as i pass , for it might be hard to pick up one 's trail again , with so many folk ever pass over it . " burst out laugh again . " by my faith , you will find lively than ever , " say he , " if you blaze your way through on the door-post as you would on the tree of a forest . but perchance it would be as well that you should have a guide at first ; so , if you have two horse ready in your stable , uncle , our friend and i might shortly ride back to together , for i have a spell of guard again before many hour be over . then for some day he might bide with me there , if he will share a soldier 's quarter , and so see more than the can offer . how would that suit you , monsieur green ? " " i should be right glad to come out with you , if we may leave all here in safety . " " oh , fear not for that , " say the huguenot . " the order of the of will be as a shield and a buckler to us for many a day . i will order to saddle the horse . " " and i must use the little time i have , " say the guardsman , as he turn away to where wait for him in the window . the young be soon ready for the expedition , but linger until the last possible minute . when at last he be able to tear himself away , he adjust his cravat , brush his brilliant coat , and look very critically over the sombre suit of his companion . " where get you those ? " he ask . " in , ere i leave . " " hem ! there be naught amiss with the cloth , and indeed the sombre colour be the mode , but the cut be strange to our eye . " " i only know that i wish that i have my fringe hunting tunic and leggings on once more . " " this hat , now . we do not wear our brim flat like that . see if i can mend it . " he take the beaver , and loop up one side of the brim , he fasten it with a golden brooch take from his own shirt front . " there be a martial cock , " say he , laugh , " and would do credit to the 's . the black and silk hose will pass , but why have you not a sword at your side ? " " i carry a gun when i ride out . " , you will be lay by the heel as a bandit ! " " i have a knife , too . " " bad and bad ! well , we must dispense with the sword , and with the gun too , i pray ! let me your cravat . so ! now if you be in the mood for a gallop , i be at your service . " they be indeed a singular contrast as they walk their horse together through the narrow and crowded causeway of the parisian street . , who be the old by five year , with his delicate face , his sharply trim moustache , his small but well-set and dainty figure , and his brilliant dress , look the very type of the great nation to which he belong . his companion , however , and strong , turn his bold and yet thoughtful face from side to side , and eagerly take in all the strange , new life amidst which he find himself , be also a type , unfinished , it be true , but bid fair to be the high of the two . his close yellow hair , blue eye , and heavy build show that it be the blood of his father , rather than that of his mother , which run in his vein ; and even the sombre coat and swordless belt , if less pleasing to the eye , be true badge of a race which find its fierce battle and its most glorious victory in bend nature to its will upon the sea and in the waste place of the earth . " what be yonder great building ? " he ask , as they emerge into a broad square . " it be the , one of the palace of the king . " " and be he there ? " " ; he live at . " " what ! fancy that a man should have two such house ! " " two ! he have many . , , , . " " but to what end ? a man can but live at one at a time . " " ; he can now come or go as the fancy take him . " " it be a wondrous building . i have see the of at , and think that it be the great of all house , and yet what be it beside this ? " " you have be to , then ? you remember the fort ? " " yes , and the , and the wooden house in a row , and eastward the great mill with the wall ; but what do you know of ? " " i have soldier there , and at , too . why , my friend , you be not the only man of the wood in , for i give you my word that i have wear the caribou , the leather jacket , and the fur cap with the eagle feather for six month at a stretch , and i care not how soon i do it again , " 's eye shine with delight at find that his companion and he have so much in common , and he plunge into a series of question which last until they have cross the river and reach the gate of the city . by the moat and wall long line of man be busy at their drill . " who be those , then ? " he ask , gaze at them with curiosity . " they be some of the king 's soldier . " " but why so many of them ? do they await some enemy ? " " ; we be at peace with all the world . bad luck ! " " at peace . why then all these man ? " " that they may be ready . " the young man shake his head in bewilderment . " they might be as ready in their own home surely . in our country every man have his musket in his chimney corner , and be ready enough , yet he do not waste his time when all be at peace . " " our king be very great , and he have many enemy . " " and who make the enemy ? " " why , the king , to be sure . " " then would it not be good to be without him ? " the guardsman shrug his epaulette in despair . " we shall both wind up in the or at this rate , " say he . " you must know that it be in serve the country that he have make these enemy . it be but five year since he make a peace at , by which he tear away sixteen fortress from the . then , also , he have lay his hand upon and upon , and have chastise the , so that there be many who would fall upon him if they think that he be weak . " " and why have he do all this ? " " because he be a great king , and for the glory of . " the stranger ponder over this answer for some time as they ride on between the high , thin poplar , which throw bar across the sunlit road . " there be a great man in once , " say he at last . " they be simple folk up yonder , and they all have great trust in each other . but after this man come among them they begin to a and one a bag of ginseng , and one a belt of wampum , until at last old lose his chestnut three-year-old . then there be a search and a fuss until they find all that have be lose in the stable of the new-comer , so we take him , i and some other , and we hang him up on a tree , without ever think what a great man he have be . " shoot an angry glance at his companion . " your parable , my friend , be scarce polite , " say he . " if you and i be to travel in peace you must keep a close guard upon your tongue . " " i would not give you offence , and it may be that i be wrong , " answer the american , " but i speak as the matter seem to me , and it be the right of a free man to do that . " 's frown relax as the other turn his earnest blue eye upon him . " by my soul , where would the court be if every man do that ? " say he . " but what in the name of heaven be amiss now ? " his companion have hurl himself off his horse , and be stoop low over the ground , with his eye bend upon the dust . then , with quick , noiseless step , he zigzag along the road , run swiftly across a grassy bank , and stand peer at the gap of a fence , with his nostril dilate , his eye shine , and his whole face aglow with eagerness . " the fellow 's brain be go , " mutter , as he catch at the bridle of the riderless horse . " the sight of have shake his wit . what in the name of the devil ail you , that you should stand glare there ? " " a deer have pass , " whisper the other , point down at the grass . " its trail lie along there and into the wood . it could not have be long ago , and there be no slur to the track , so that it be not go fast . have we but fetch my gun , we might have follow it , and bring the old man back a side of venison . " " for 's sake get on your horse again ! " cry distractedly . " i fear that some evil will come upon you ere i get you safe to the again ! " " and what be wrong now ? " ask , swing himself into the saddle . " why , man , these wood be the king 's preserve and you speak as coolly of slay his deer as though you be on the shore of ! " " preserve ! they be tame deer ! " an expression of deep disgust pass over his face , and spur his horse , he gallop onwards at such a pace that , after vainly endeavour to keep up , have to shriek to him to stop . " it be not usual in this country to ride so madly along the road , " he pant . " it be a very strange country , " cry the stranger , in perplexity . " maybe it would be easy for me to remember what allow . it be but this morning that i take my gun to shoot a pigeon that be fly over the roof in yonder street , and old catch my arm with a face as though it be the minister that i be aim at . and then there be that old , they will not even let him say his prayer . " laugh . " you will come to know our way soon , " say he . " this be a crowded land , and if all man ride and shoot as they list , much harm would come from it . but let us talk rather of your own country . you have live much in the wood from what you tell me . " " i be but ten when first i journey with my uncle to la , where the three great lake meet , to trade with the chippewa and the tribe of the west . " " i know not what or would have say to that . the trade in those part belong to . " " we be take prisoner , and so it be that i come to see and afterwards . in the end we be send back because they do not know what they could do with us . " " it be a good journey for a first . " " and ever since i have be , on the with the , in the great forest of , and with the over the penobscot . then later with the , as far west as the country of the . at and we store our pelt , and so on to , where my father ship them over the sea . " " but he could ill spare you surely ? " " very ill . but as he be rich , he think it best that i should learn some thing that be not to be find in the wood . and so he send me in the , under the care of . " " who be also of ? " " ; he be the first man that ever be bear at . " " i can remember the name of all these village . " " and yet there may come a day when their name shall be as well know as that of . " laugh heartily . " the wood may have give you much , but not the gift of prophecy , my friend . well , my heart be often over the water even as yours be , and i would ask nothing good than to see the palisade of again , even if all the five be rave upon the other side of them . but now , if you will look there in the gap of the tree , you will see the king 's new palace . " the two young man pull up their horse , and look down at the building in all the beauty of its dazzling whiteness , and at the lovely ground , dot with fountain and with statue , and bar with hedge and with walk , stretch away to the dense wood which cluster round them . it amuse to watch the swift play of wonder and admiration which flash over his companion 's feature . " well , what do you think of it ? " he ask at last . " i think that 's good work be in , and man be in . " " ay , and in all there be no such palace as that , even as there be no such king as he who dwell within it . " " can i see him , think you ? " " who , the king ? no , no ; i fear that you be scarce make for a court . " " nay , i should show him all honour . " " how , then ? what greeting would you give him ? " " i would shake him respectfully by the hand , and ask as to his health and that of his family . " " on my word , i think that such a greeting might please him more than the bent knee and the rounded back , and yet , i think , my son of the wood , that it be well not to lead you into path where you would be lose , as would any of the courtier if you drop them in the gorge of the saguenay . but ! what come here ? it look like one of the carriage of the court . " a white cloud of dust , which have roll towards them down the road , be now so near that the glint of gilding and the red coat of the coachman could be see break out through it . as the two cavalier rein their horse aside to leave the roadway clear , the coach rumble heavily past them , draw by two dapple gray , and the catch a glimpse , as it pass , of a beautiful but haughty face which look out at them . an instant afterwards a sharp cry have cause the driver to pull up his horse , and a white hand beckon to them through the carriage window . " it be madame , the proud woman in , " whisper . " she would speak with us , so do as i do . " he touch his horse with the spur , give a which take him across to the carriage , and then , sweep off his hat , he bow to his horse 's neck ; a salute in which he be imitate , though in a somewhat ungainly fashion , by his companion . " , captain ! " say the lady , with no very pleasant face , " we meet again . " " have ever be good to me , madame . " " it be not so this morning . " " you say truly . it give me a hateful duty to perform . " " and you perform it in a hateful fashion . " " , madame , what could i do more ? " the lady sneer , and her beautiful face turn as bitter as it could upon occasion . " you think that i have no more power with the king . you think that my day be past . no doubt it seem to you that you might reap favour with the new by be the first to cast a slight upon the old . " " but , -- " " you may spare your protestation . i be one who judge by deed and not by word . do you , then , think that my charm have so fade , that any beauty which i ever have have be so wither ? " " , madame , i be blind to think that . " " blind as a noontide owl , " say with emphasis . madame arch her eyebrow and glance at her singular admirer . " your friend at least speak that which he really feel , " say she . " at four o'clock we shall see whether other be of the same mind ; and if they be , then it may be ill for those who mistake what be but a pass shadow for a lasting cloud . " she cast another vindictive glance at the young guardsman , and rattle on once more upon her way . " come on ! " cry curtly , for his companion be stare open-mouthed after the carriage . " have you never see a woman before ? " " never such a one as that . " " never one with so rail a tongue , i dare swear , " say . " never one with so lovely a face . and yet there be a lovely face at the also . " " you seem to have a nice taste in beauty , for all your woodland training . " " yes , for i have be cut away from woman so much that when i stand before one i feel that she be something tender and sweet and holy . " " you may find dame at the court who be both tender and sweet , but you will look long , my friend , before you find the holy one . this one would ruin me if she can , and only because i have do what it be my duty to do . to keep oneself in this court be like come down the where there be a rock to right , and a rock to left , and another perchance in front , and if you so much as graze one , where be you and your birch canoe ? but our rock be woman , and in our canoe we bear all our worldly fortune . now here be another who would sway me over to her side , and indeed i think it may prove to be the good side too . " they have pass through the gateway of the palace , and the broad sweeping drive lie in front of them , dot with carriage and horseman . on the gravel walk be many gaily dress lady , who stroll among the or watch the fountain with the sunlight glint upon their high water spray . one of these , who have keep her eye turn upon the gate , come hasten forward the instant that appear . it be mademoiselle , the confidante of madame . " i be so please to see you , captain , " she cry , " and i have wait so patiently . madame would speak with you . the king come to her at three , and we have but twenty minute . i hear that you have go to , and so i station myself here . madame have something which she would ask you . " " then i will come at once . ah , , it be well meet ! " a tall , burly officer be pass in the same uniform which wear . he turn at once , and come smile towards his comrade . " ah , , you have cover a league or two from the dust on your coat ! " " we be fresh from . but i be call on business . this be my friend , monsieur . i leave him in your hand , for he be a stranger from , and would fain see all that you can show . he stay with me at my quarter . and my horse , too , . you can give it to the groom . " throw the bridle to his brother officer , and press the hand of , spring from his horse , and follow at the top of his speed in the direction which the young lady have already take . the room which be inhabit by the lady who have already take so mark a position at the court of be as humble as be her fortune at the time when they be allot to her , but with that rare tact and self-restraint which be the lead feature in her remarkable character , she have make no change in her living with the increase of her prosperity , and forbear from provoke envy and jealousy by any display of wealth or of power . in a side wing of the palace , far from the central salon , and only to be reach by long corridor and stair , be the two or three small chamber upon which the eye , first of the court , then of , and finally of the world , be destine to be turn . in such room have the destitute widow of the poet be house when she have first be bring to court by madame as the governess of the royal child , and in such room she still dwell , now that she have add to her maiden the title of , with the pension and estate which the king 's favour have award her . here it be that every day the king would lounge , find in the conversation of a clever and virtuous woman a charm and a pleasure which none of the professed wit of his sparkling court have ever be able to give to him , and here , too , the more sagacious of the courtier be begin to understand , be the point , formerly to be find in the magnificent salon of , whence flow those impulse and tendency which be so eagerly study , and so keenly follow up by all who wish to keep the favour of the king . it be a simple creed , that of the court . be the king pious , then let all turn to their missal and their rosary . be he rakish , then who so rakish as his devoted follower ? but woe to the man who be rakish when he should be pray , or who pull a long face when the king wear a laughing one ! and thus it be that keen eye be ever fix upon him , and upon every influence that come near him , so that the wary courtier , watch the first subtle sign of a come change , might so order his conduct as to seem to lead rather than to follow . the young guardsman have scarce ever exchange a word with this powerful lady , for it be her taste to isolate herself , and to appear with the court only at the hour of devotion . it be therefore with some feeling both of nervousness and of curiosity that he follow his guide down the gorgeous corridor , where art and wealth have be strew with so lavish a hand . the lady pause in front of the chamber door , and turn to her companion . " madame wish to speak to you of what occur this morning , " say she . " i should advise you to say nothing to madame about your creed , for it be the only thing upon which her heart can be hard . " she raise her finger to emphasise the warning , and tap at the door , she push it open . " i have bring , madame , " say she . " then let the captain step in . " the voice be firm , and yet sweetly musical . obey the command , find himself in a room which be no large and but little well furnish than that which be allot to his own use . yet , though simple , everything in the chamber be scrupulously neat and clean , betray the dainty taste of a refined woman . the furniture , the carpet , the picture of sacred subject , exquisite from an artist 's point of view , the plain but tasteful curtain , all leave an impression half religious and half feminine but wholly soothing . indeed , the soft light , the high white statue of the in a canopy niche , with a perfume red lamp burn before it , and the wooden prie-dieu with the prayer-book upon the top of it , make the apartment look more like a private chapel than a fair lady 's boudoir . on each side of the empty fireplace be a little , the one for madame and the other reserve for the use of the king . a small three-legged stool between them be heap with her work-basket and her tapestry . on the chair which be furthest from the door , with her back turn to the light , madame be sit as the young officer enter . it be her favourite position , and yet there be few woman of her year who have so little reason to fear the sun , for a healthy life and active habit have leave her with a clear skin and delicate bloom which any young beauty of the court might have envy . her figure be graceful and queenly , her gesture and pose full of a natural dignity , and her voice , as he have already remark , most sweet and melodious . her face be handsome rather than beautiful , set in a statuesque classical mould , with broad white forehead , firm , delicately sensitive mouth , and a pair of large serene gray eye , earnest and placid in repose , but capable of reflect the whole play of her soul , from the merry gleam of humour to the quick flash of righteous anger . an elevate serenity be , however , the lead expression of her feature , and in that she present the strong contrast to her rival , whose beautiful face be ever sweep by the emotion of the moment , and who gleam one hour and shadow over the next like a in the wind . in wit and quickness of tongue it be true that have the advantage , but the strong common-sense and the deep nature of the elder woman might prove in the end to be the good weapon . , at the moment , without have time to notice detail , be simply conscious that he be in the presence of a very handsome woman , and that her large pensive eye be fix critically upon him , and seem to be read his thought as they have never be read before . " i think that i have already see you , sir , have i not ? " " yes , madame , i have once or twice have the honour of attend upon you though it may not have be my good fortune to address you . " " my life be so quiet and retire that i fear that much of what be good and worthy at the court be unknown to me . it be the curse of such place that evil flaunt itself before the eye and can be overlook , while the good retire in its modesty , so that at time we scarce dare hope that it be there . you have serve , monsieur ? " " yes , madame . in the , on the , and in . " " in ! ah ! what noble ambition could woman have than to be a member of that sweet sisterhood which be found by the holy and the sainted le at ? it be but the other day that i have an account of them from . what joy to be one of such a body , and to turn from the bless work of convert the heathen to the even more precious task of nurse back health and strength into those of 's warrior who have be strike down in the fight with satan ! " it be strange to , who know well the sordid and dreadful existence lead by these same sister , threaten ever with misery , hunger , and the , to hear this lady at whose foot lay all the good thing of this earth speak enviously of their lot . " they be very good woman , " say he shortly , remember mademoiselle 's warning , and fear to trench upon the dangerous subject . " and doubtless you have have the privilege also of see the holy ? " " yes , madame , i have see . " " and i trust that the still hold their own against the jesuit ? " " i have hear , madame , that the jesuit be the strong at , and the other at . " " and who be your own director , monsieur ? " feel that the worst have come upon him . " i have none , madame . " " ah , it be too common to dispense with a director , and yet i know not how i could guide my step in the difficult path which i tread if it be not for mine . who be your confessor , then ? " " i have none . i be of the reformed , madame . " the lady give a gesture of horror , and a sudden hardening show itself in mouth and eye . " what , in the court itself , " she cry , " and in the neighbourhood of the king 's own person ! " be lax enough in matter of faith , and hold his creed rather as a family tradition than from any strong conviction , but it hurt his self-esteem to see himself regard as though he have confess to something that be loathsome and unclean . " you will find , madame , " say he sternly , " that member of my faith have not only stand around the throne of , but have even seat themselves upon it . " " have for his own all-wise purpose permit it , and none should know it good than i , whose grandsire , , do so much to place a crown upon the head of the great . but 's eye be open ere his end come , and i , from my heart i yours may be also . " she rise , and throw herself down upon the prie-dieu sink her face in her hand for some few minute , during which the object of her devotion stand in some perplexity in the middle of the room , hardly know whether such an attention should be regard as an insult or as a favour . a tap at the door bring the lady back to this world again , and her devoted attendant answer her summons to enter . " the king be in the of , madame , " say she . " he will be here in five minute . " " very well . stand outside , and let me know when he come . now , sir , " she continue , when they be alone once more , " you give a note of mine to the king this morning ? " " i do , madame . " " and , as i understand , madame be refuse admittance to the grand lever ? " " she be , madame . " " but she wait for the king in the passage ? " " she do . " " and wring from him a promise that he would see her ? " " yes , madame . " " i would not have you tell me that which it may seem to you a breach of your duty to tell . but i be fight now against a terrible foe , and for a great stake . do you understand me ? " bow . " then what do i mean ? " " i presume that what madame mean be that she be fight for the king 's favour with the lady you mention . " " as heaven be my judge , i have no think of myself . i be fight with the devil for the king 's soul . " " ' the same thing , madame . " the lady smile . " if the king 's body be in peril , i could call on the aid of his faithful guard , and not less so now , surely , when so much more be at stake . tell me , then , at what hour be the king to meet the marquise in her room ? " " at four , madame . " " i thank you . you have do me a service , and i shall not forget it . " " the king come , madame , " say mademoiselle , again protrude her head . " then you must go , captain . pass through the other room , and so into the outer passage . and take this . it be 's statement of the catholic faith . it have soften the heart of other , and may yours . now , adieu ! " pass out through another door , and as he do so he glance back . the lady have her back to him , and her hand be raise to the . at the instant that he look she move her neck , and he could see what she be do . she be push back the long hand of the clock . have hardly vanish through the one door before the other be throw open by mademoiselle , and the king enter the room . madame rise with a pleasant smile and curtsy deeply , but there be no answer light upon her visitor 's face , and he throw himself down upon the vacant with a pout lip and a frown upon his forehead . " nay , now this be a very bad compliment , " she cry , with the gaiety which she could assume whenever it be necessary to draw the king from his black humour . " my poor little dark room have already cast a shadow over you . " " ; it be and the of who have be after me all day like two hound on a stag , with talk of my duty and my position and my sin , with judgment and ever at the end of their exhortation . " " and what would they have your majesty do ? " " break the promise which i make when i come upon the throne , and which my grandfather make before me . they wish me to recall the edict of , and drive the huguenot from the kingdom . " " oh , but your majesty must not trouble your mind about such matter . " " you would not have me do it , madame ? " " not if it be to be a grief to your majesty . " " you have , perchance , some soft feeling for the religion of your youth ? " " , sire ; i have nothing but hatred for heresy . " " and yet you would not have them thrust out ? " " bethink you , sire , that the can incline their heart to good thing if he be so mind , even as mine be incline . may you not leave it in his hand ? " " on my word , " say , brighten , " it be well put . i shall see if can find an answer to that . it be hard to be threaten with eternal flame because one will not ruin one 's kingdom . eternal torment ! i have see the face of a man who have be in the , for fifteen year . it be like a dreadful book , with a scar or a wrinkle to mark every hour of that death in life . but ! " he shudder , and his eye be fill with the horror of his thought . the high motive have but little power over his soul , as those about him have long discover , but he be ever ready to wince at the image of the terror to come . " why should you think of such thing , sire ? " say the lady , in her rich , soothing voice . " what have you to fear , you who have be the first son of the church ? " " you think that i be safe , then ? " " surely , sire . " " but i have err , and err deeply . you have yourself say as much . " " but that be all over , sire . who be there who be without stain ? you have turn away from temptation . surely , then , you have earn your forgiveness . " " i would that the queen be live once more . she would find me a good man . " " i would that she be , sire . " " and she should know that it be to you that she owe the change . oh , , you be surely my guardian angel , who have take bodily form ! how can i thank you for what you have do for me ? " he lean forward and take her hand , but at the touch a sudden fire spring into his eye , and he would have pass his other arm round her have she not rise hurriedly to avoid the embrace . " sire ! " say she , with a rigid face and one finger upraise . " you be right , you be right , . sit down , and i will control myself . still at the same tapestry , then ! my worker at the must look to their laurel . " he raise one border of the glossy roll , while she , have reseat herself , though not without a quick questioning glance at her companion , take the other end into her lap and continue her work . " yes , sire . it be a hunting scene in your forest at . a stag of ten tine , you see , and the hound in full cry , and a gallant band of cavalier and lady . have your ridden ? " " no. how be it , , that you have such a heart of ice ? " " i would it be so , sire . perhaps you have hawk , then ? " " no. but surely no man 's love have ever stir you ! and yet you have be a wife . " " a nurse , sire , but never a wife . see the lady in the park ! it be surely mademoiselle . i do not know that she have come up from . " but the king be not to be distract from his subject . " you do not love this , then ? " he persist . " he be old , i have hear , and as lame as some of his verse . " " do not speak lightly of him , sire . i be grateful to him ; i honour him ; i like him . " " but you do not love him . " " why should you seek to read the secret of a woman 's heart ? " " you do not love him , ? " " at least i do my duty towards him . " " have that nun 's heart never yet be touch by love then ? " " sire , do not question me . " " have it -- " " me , sire , i beg of you ! " " but i must ask , for my own peace hang upon your answer . " " your word pain me to the soul . " " have you never , , feel in your heart some little flicker of the love which glow in mine ? " he rise with his hand outstretch , a plead monarch , but she , with bead , still shrink away from him . " be assure of one thing , sire , " say she , " that even if i love you as no woman ever love a man yet , i should rather spring from that window on to the stone terrace beneath than ever by word or sign confess as much to you . " " and why , ? " " because , sire , it be my high hope upon earth that i have be choose to lift up your mind towards lofty mind the greatness and nobility of which none know more than " " and be my love so base , then ? " " you have waste too much of your life and of your thought upon woman 's love . and now , sire , the year steal on and the day be come when even you will be call upon to give an account of your action , and of the innermost thought of your heart . i would see you spend the time that be leave to you , sire , in build up the church , in show a noble example to your subject , and in repair any evil which that example may have do in the past . " the king sink back into his chair with a groan . " forever the same , " say he . " why , you be bad than and . " " , nay , " say she gaily , with the quick tact in which she never fail . " i have weary you , when you have stoop to honour my little room with your presence . that be indeed ingratitude , and it be a just punishment if you be to leave me in solitude , and so cut off all the light of my day . but tell me , sire , how go the work at ? i be all on fire to know whether the great fountain will work . " " yes , the fountain play well , but have throw the right wing too far back . i have make him a good architect , but i have still much to teach him . i show him his fault on the plan this morning , and he promise to amend it . " " and what will the change cost , sire ? " " some million of livre , but then the view will be much improve from the south side . i have take in another mile of ground in that direction , for there be a number of poor folk live there , and their hovel be far from pretty . " " and why have you not ridden , sire ? " " ! it bring me no pleasure . there be a time when my blood be stir by the blare of the horn and the rush of the hoof , but now it be all wearisome to me . " " and hawk too ? " " yes ; i shall hawk no more . " " but , sire , you must have amusement . " " what be so dull as an amusement which have cease to amuse ? i know not how it be . when i be but a lad , and my mother and i be drive from place to place , with the at war with us and in revolt , with our throne and even our life in danger , all life seem to be so bright , so new , and so full of interest . now that there be no shadow , and that my voice be the first in , as 's be in , all be dull and lack in flavour . what use be it to have all pleasure before me , when it turn to wormwood when it be taste ? " " true pleasure , sire , lie rather in the inward life , the serene mind , the easy conscience . and then , as we grow old , be it not natural that our mind should take a graver bent ? we might well reproach ourselves if it be not so , for it would show that we have not learn the lesson of life . " " it may be so , and yet it be sad and weary when nothing amuse . but who be there ? " " it be my companion knock . what be it , mademoiselle ? " " monsieur , to read to the king , " say the young lady , open the door . " ah , yes , sire ; i know how foolish be a woman 's tongue , and so i have bring a wise one than mine here to charm you . monsieur be to have come , but i hear that he have have a fall from his horse , and he send his friend in his place . shall i admit him ? " " oh , as you like , madame , as you like , " say the king listlessly . at a sign from mademoiselle a little peaky man with a shrewd petulant face , and long gray hair fall back over his shoulder , enter the room . he bow profoundly three time , and then seat himself nervously on the very edge of the stool , from which the lady have remove her work-basket . she smile and nod to encourage the poet , while the monarch lean back in his chair with an air of resignation . " shall it be a comedy , or a tragedy , or a burlesque pastoral ? " ask timidly . " not the burlesque pastoral , " say the king with decision . " such thing may be play , but can be read , since they be for the eye rather than the ear . " the poet bow his acquiescence . " and not the tragedy , monsieur , " say madame , glance up from her tapestry . " the king have enough that be serious in his graver hour , and so i trust that you will use your talent to amuse him . " " ay , let it be a comedy , " say ; " i have not have a good laugh since poor pass away . " " ah , your majesty have indeed a fine taste , " cry the courtier poet . " have you condescend to turn your own attention to poetry , where should we all have be then ? " smile , for no flattery be too gross to please him . " even as you have teach our general war and our builder art , so you would have set your poor singer a lofty strain . but would hardly deign to share the humble laurel of . " " i have sometimes think that i have some such power , " answer the king complacently ; " though amid my toil and the burden of state i have have , as you say , little time for the soft art . " " but you have encourage other to do what you could so well have do yourself , sire . you have bring out poet as the sun bring out flower . how many have we not , , , one great than the other ? and the other , too , the small , so scurrilous and yet so , holy ! what have i say ? " madame have lay down her tapestry , and be stare in intense indignation at the poet , who writhe on his stool under the stern rebuke of those cold gray eye . " i think , monsieur , that you have well go on with your reading , " say the king dryly . " assuredly , sire . shall i read my play about ? " " and who be ? " ask the king , whose education have be so neglect by the crafty policy of that he be ignorant of everything save what have come under his own personal observation . " be of , sire . " " and where be ? " " it be a kingdom of . " " be still king there ? " " , sire ; he fight against the . " " ah , i have hear of . he be a famous king and general , be he not ? " " like your majesty , he both rule wisely and lead his army victoriously . " " and be of , you say ? " " no , sire ; of . it be who be of . " the king frown , for the slight correction be offensive to him . " you do not seem very clear about the matter , and i confess that it do not interest me deeply , " say he . " pray turn to something else . " " there be my . " " yes , that will do . " commence to read his comedy , while madame 's white and delicate finger pick among the silk which she be weave into her tapestry . from time to time she glance across , first at the clock and then at the king , who be lean back , with his lace handkerchief throw over his face . it be twenty minute to four now , but she know that she have put it back half an hour , and that the true time be ten minute past . " tut ! tut ! " cry the king suddenly . " there be something amiss there . the second last line have a limp in it , surely . " it be one of his foible to pose as a critic , and the wise poet would fall in with his correction , however unreasonable they might be . " which line , sire ? it be indeed an advantage to have one 's fault make clear . " " read the passage again . " " , le secret , ma , ma vivre , et , le present . " " yes , the third line have a foot too many . do you not remark it , madame ? " " no ; but i fear that i should make a poor critic . " " your majesty be perfectly right , " say unblushingly . " i shall mark the passage , and see that it be correct . " " i think that it be wrong . if i do not write myself , you can see that i have at least get the correct ear . a false quantity jar upon me . it be the same in music . although i know little of the matter , i can tell a discord where himself would miss it . i have often show him error of the sort in his opera , and i have always convince him that i be right . " " i can readily believe it , your majesty . " have pick up his book again , and be about to resume his reading when there come a sharp tap at the door . " it be his highness the minister , monsieur , " say mademoiselle . " admit him , " answer . " monsieur , i be oblige to you for what you have read , and i regret that an affair of state will now interrupt your comedy . some other day perhaps i may have the pleasure of hear the rest of it . " he smile in the gracious fashion which make all who come within his personal influence forget his fault and remember him only as the impersonation of dignity and of courtesy . the poet , with his book under his arm , slip out , while the famous minister , tall , heavily wigged , , and commanding , come bow into the little room . his manner be that of exaggerated politeness , but his haughty face mark only too plainly his contempt for such a chamber and for the lady who dwell there . she be well aware of the feeling with which he regard her , but her perfect self-command prevent her from ever by word or look return his dislike . " my apartment be indeed honour , " say she , rise with outstretch hand . " can monsieur condescend to a stool , since i have no fit seat to offer you in this little doll 's house ? but perhaps i be in the way , if you wish to talk of state affair to the king . i can easily withdraw into my boudoir . " " no , no , nothing of the kind , madame , " cry . " it be my wish that you should remain here . what be it , ? " " a messenger arrive from with despatch , your majesty , " answer the minister , his ponderous figure balance upon the three-legged stool . " there be very ill feeling there , and there be some talk of a rising . the letter from wish to know whether , in case the take the side of the malcontent , the king might look to for help . of course , know your 's mind , i answer unhesitatingly that he might . " " you do what ? " " i answer , sire , that he might . " flush with anger , and he catch up the tong from the grate with a motion as though he would have strike his minister with them . madame spring from her chair , and lay her hand upon his arm with a soothing gesture . he throw down the tong again , but his eye still flash with passion as he turn them upon . " how dare you ? " he cry . " but , -- " " how dare you , i say ? what ! you venture to answer such a message without consult me ! how often be i to tell you that i be the state- -- i alone ; that all be to come from me ; and that i be answerable to only ? what be you ? my instrument ! my tool ! and you venture to act without my authority ! " " i think that i know your wish , sire , " stammer , whose haughty manner have quite desert him , and whose face be as white as the ruffle of his shirt . " you be not there to think about my wish , sir . you be there to consult them and to obey them . why be it that i have turn away from my old nobility , and have commit the affair of my kingdom to man whose name have never be hear of in the history of , such man as and yourself ? i have be blame for it . there be the , who say , the last time that he be at the court , that it be a bourgeois government . so it be . but i wish it to be so , because i know that the noble have a way of think for themselves , and i ask for no thought but mine in the governing of . but if my bourgeois be to receive message and give answer to embassy , then indeed i be to be pity . i have mark you of late , . you have grow beyond your station . you take too much upon yourself . see to it that i have not again to complain to you upon this matter . " the humiliate minister sit as one crushed , with his chin sink upon his breast . the king mutter and frown for a few minute , but the cloud clear gradually from his face , for his fit of anger be usually as short as they be fierce and sudden . " you will detain that messenger , , " he say at last , in a calm voice . " yes , sire . " " and we shall see at the council meeting that a fitting reply be send to . it would be well perhaps not to be too free with our promise in the matter . these have ever be a thorn in our side . if we could leave them among their own fog with such a quarrel as would keep them busy for a few year , then indeed we might crush this dutch prince at our leisure . their last civil war last ten year , and their next may do as much . we could carry our frontier to the long ere that . , ? " " your army be ready , sire , on the day that you give the word . " " but war be a costly business . i do not wish to have to sell the court plate , as we do the other day . how be the public fund ? " " we be not very rich , sire . but there be one way in which money may very readily be gain . there be some talk this morning about the huguenot , and whether they should dwell any longer in this catholic kingdom . now , if they be drive out , and if their property be take by the state , then indeed your majesty would at once become the rich monarch in . " " but you be against it this morning , ? " " i have not have time to think of it , sire . " " you mean that and the bishop have not have time to get at you , " say sharply . " ah , , i have not live with a court round me all these year without learn how thing be do . it be a word to him , and so on to another , and so to a third , and so to the king . when my good father of the have set themselves to bring anything to pass , i see trace of them at every turn , as one trace a mole by the dirt which it have throw up . but i will not be move against my own reason to do wrong to those who , however mistake they may be , be still the subject whom have give me . " " i would not have you do so , sire , " cry in confusion . the king 's accusation have be so true that he have be unable at the moment even to protest . " i know but one person , " continue , glance across at madame , " who have no ambition , who desire neither wealth nor preferment , and who can therefore never be bribe to sacrifice my interest . that be why i value that person 's opinion so highly . " he smile at the lady as he speak , while his minister cast a glance at her which show the jealousy which eat into his soul . " it be my duty to point this out to you , sire , not as a suggestion , but as a possibility , " say he , rise . " i fear that i have already take up too much of your 's time , and i shall now withdraw . " bow slightly to the lady , and profoundly to the monarch , he walk from the room . " grow intolerable , " say the king . " i know not where his insolence will end . be it not that he be an excellent servant , i should have send him from the court before this . he have his own opinion upon everything . it be but the other day that he would have it that i be wrong when i say that one of the window in the be small than any of the other . it be the same size , say he . i bring with his measure , and of course the window be , as i have say , too small . but i see by your clock that it be four o'clock . i must go . " " my clock , sire , be half an hour slow . " " half an hour ! " the king look dismay for an instant , and then begin to laugh . " nay , in that case , " say he , " i have well remain where i be , for it be too late to go , and i can say with a clear conscience that it be the clock 's fault rather than mine . " " i trust that it be nothing of very great importance , sire , " say the lady , with a look of demure triumph in her eye . " by no mean . " " no state affair ? " " no , no ; it be only that it be the hour at which i have intend to rebuke the conduct of a presumptuous person . but perhaps it be good as it be . my absence will in itself convey my message , and in such a sort that i trust i may never see that person 's face more at my court . but , , what be this ? " the door have be fling open , and madame , beautiful and furious , be stand before them . madame be a woman who be always full of self-restraint and of cool resource . she have rise in an instant , with an air as if she have at last see the welcome guest for whom she have pine in vain . with a frank smile of greeting , she advance with outstretch hand . " this be indeed a pleasure , " say she . but madame be very angry , so angry that she be evidently make strong effort to keep herself within control , and to avoid break into a furious outburst . her face be very pale , her lip compress , and her blue eye have the set stare and the cold glitter of a furious woman . so for an instant they face each other , the one frown , the other smile , two of the most beautiful and queenly woman in . then , disregard her rival 's outstretch hand , turn towards the king , who have be look at her with a darken face . " i fear that i intrude , sire . " " your entrance , madame , be certainly somewhat abrupt . " " i must crave pardon if it be so . since this lady have be the governess of my child i have be in the habit of come into her room unannounced . " " as far as i be concern , you be most welcome to do so , " say her rival , with perfect composure . " i confess that i have not even think it necessary to ask your permission , madame , " the other answer coldly . " then you shall certainly do so in the future , madame , " say the king sternly . " it be my express order to you that every possible respect be to be show in every way to this lady . " " oh , to this lady ! " with a wave of her hand in her direction . " your 's command be of course our law . but i must remember that it this lady , for sometimes one may get confuse as to which name it be that your majesty have pick out for honour . it be ; yesterday it be ; , well , who can say who it may be ? " she be superb in her pride and her fearlessness as she stand , with her sparkling blue eye and her heave bosom , look down upon her royal lover . angry as he be , his gaze lose something of its sternness as it rest upon her round full throat and the delicate line of her shapely shoulder . there be something very become in her passion , in the defiant pose of her dainty head , and the magnificent scorn with which she glance at her rival . " there be nothing to be gain , madame , by be insolent , " say he . " nor be it my custom , sire . " " and yet i find your word so . " " truth be always mistake for insolence , sire , at the court of . " " we have have enough of this . " " a very little truth be enough . " " you forget yourself , madame . i beg that you will leave the room . " " i must first remind your majesty that i be so far honour as to have an appointment this afternoon . at four o'clock i have your royal promise that you would come to me . i can doubt that your majesty will keep that promise in spite of the fascination which you may find here . " " i should have come , madame , but the clock , as you may observe , be half an hour slow , and the time have pass before i be aware of it . " i beg , sire , that you will not let that distress you . i be return to my chamber , and five o'clock will suit me as well as four . " " i thank you , madame , but i have not find this interview so pleasant that i should seek another . " " then your majesty will not come ? " " i should prefer not . " " in spite of your promise ! " " madame ! " " you will break your word ! " " silence , madame ; this be intolerable . " " it be indeed intolerable ! " cry the angry lady , throw all discretion to the wind . " oh , i be not afraid of you , sire . i have love you , but i have never fear you . i leave you here . i leave you with your conscience and lady confessor . but one word of truth you shall hear before i go . you have be false to your wife , and you have be false to your mistress , but it be only now that i find that you can be false also to your word . " she sweep him an indignant courtesy , and glide , with head erect , out of the room . the king spring from his chair as if he have be sting . accustom as he be to his gentle little wife , and the even gentle , such language as this have never before intrude itself upon the royal ear . it be like a physical blow to him . he feel stun , humiliate , bewilder , by so unwonted a sensation . what odour be this which mingle for the first time with the incense amid which he live ? and then his whole soul rise up in anger at her , at the woman who have dare to raise her voice against him . that she should be jealous of and insult another woman , that be excusable . it be , in fact , an indirect compliment to himself . but that she should turn upon him , as if they be merely man and woman , instead of monarch and subject , that be too much . he give an inarticulate cry of rage , and rush to the door . " sire ! " madame , who have watch keenly the swift play of his emotion over his expressive face , take two quick step forward , and lay her hand upon his arm . " i will go after her . " " and why , sire ? " to forbid her the court . " " but , -- " " you hear her ! it be infamous ! i shall go . " " but , sire , could you not write ? " " no , no ; i shall see her . " he pull open the door . " oh , sire , be firm , then ! " it be with an anxious face that she watch him start off , walk rapidly , with angry gesture , down the corridor . then she turn back , and drop upon her knee on the prie-dieu , bow her head in prayer for the king , for herself , and for . , the guardsman , have employ himself in show his young friend from over the water all the wonder of the great palace , which the other have examine keenly , and have criticise or admire with an independence of judgment and a native correctness of taste natural to a man whose life have be spend in freedom amid the noble work of nature . as be the mighty fountain and the artificial cascade , they have no overwhelming effect on one who have travel up from to , and have see the hurl itself over its precipice , nor be the long level sward so very large to eye which have rest upon the great plain of the . the building itself , however , its extent , its height , and the beauty of its stone , fill him with astonishment . " i must bring here , " he keep repeat . " he would never believe else that there be one house in the world which would weigh more than all and put together . " have arrange that the should remain with his friend , as the time have come round for his own second turn of guard . he have hardly station himself in the corridor when he be astonish to see the , without escort or attendant , walk swiftly down the passage . his delicate face be disfigure with anger , and his mouth be set grimly , like that of a man who have take a momentous resolution . " officer of the guard , " say he shortly . " yes , sire . " " what ! you again , ? you have not be on duty since morning ? " " no , sire . it be my second guard . " " very good . i wish your assistance . " " i be at your command , sire . " " be there a subaltern here ? " " lieutenant de la be at the side guard . " " very well . you will place him in command . " " yes , sire . " " you will yourself go to monsieur . you know his apartment ? " " yes , sire . " " if he be not there , you must go and seek him . wherever he be , you must find him within the hour . " " yes , sire . " " you will give him an order from me . at six o'clock he be to be in his carriage at the east gate of the palace . his sister , madame , will await him there , and he be charge by me to drive her to the of . you will tell him that he be answerable to me for her arrival there . " " yes , sire . " raise his sword in salute , and start upon his mission . the king pass on down the corridor , and open a door which lead him into a magnificent , all one blaze of mirror and gold , furnish to a marvel with the most delicate ebony and silver suite , on a deep red carpet of , as soft and yield as the moss of a forest . in keep with the furniture be the sole occupant of this stately little negro boy in a livery of velvet pick out with silver tinsel , who stand as motionless as a small swart statuette against the door which face that through which the king enter . " be your mistress there ? " " she have just return , sire . " " i wish to see her . " " pardon , sire , but -- " " be everyone to thwart me ? " snarl the king , and take the little page by his velvet collar , he hurl him to the other side of the room . then , without knock , he open the door , and pass on into the lady 's boudoir . it be a large and lofty room , very different to that from which he have just come . three long window from ceiling to floor take up one side , and through the delicate blind the evening sun cast a subdued and dainty light . great gold candelabrum glitter between the mirror upon the wall , and have expend all his wealth of colour upon the ceiling , where himself , in the character of , hurl down his upon a writhe heap of dutch and palatine . pink be the prevailing tone in tapestry , carpet , and furniture , so that the whole room seem to shine with the sweet tint of the inner side of a shell , and when light up , as it be then , form such a chamber as some fairy hero might have build up for his princess . at the further side , prone upon an ottoman , her face bury in the cushion , her beautiful white arm throw over it , the rich coil of her brown hair hang in disorder across the long curve of her ivory neck , lie , like a droop flower , the woman whom he have come to discard . at the sound of the closing door she have glance up , and then , at the sight of the king , she spring to her foot and run towards him , her hand out , her blue eye bedim with tear , her whole beautiful figure softening into womanliness and humility . " ah , sire , " she cry , with a pretty little sunburst of joy through her tear , " then i have wrong you ! i have wrong you cruelly ! you have keep your promise . you be but try my faith ! oh , how could i have say such word to could i pain that noble heart ! but you have come after me to tell me that you have forgive me ! " she put her arm forward with the trusting air of a pretty child who claim an embrace as her due , but the king step swiftly back from her , and warn her away from him with an angry gesture . " all be over forever between us , " he cry harshly . " your brother will await you at the east gate at six o'clock , and it be my command that you wait there until you receive my further order . " she stagger back as if he have strike her . " leave you ! " she cry . " you must leave the court . " " the court ! ay , willingly , this instant ! but you ! ah , sire , you ask what be impossible . " " i do not ask , madame ; i order . since you have learn to abuse your position , your presence have become intolerable . the unite king of have never dare to speak to me as you have speak . you have insult me in my own , , the king . such thing be not do twice , madame . your insolence have carry you too far this time . you think that because i be forbear , i be therefore weak . it appear to you that if you only humour me one moment , you might treat me as if i be your equal the next , for that this poor puppet of a king could always be bend this way or that . you see your mistake now . at six o'clock you leave forever . " his eye flash , and his small upright figure seem to swell in the violence of his indignation , while she lean away from him , one hand across her eye and one throw forward , as if to screen her from that angry gaze . " oh , i have be wicked ! " she cry . " i know it , i know it ! " " i be glad , madame , that you have the grace to acknowledge it . " " how could i speak to you so ! how could i ! oh , that some blight may come upon this unhappy tongue ! i , who have have nothing but good from you ! i to insult you , who be the author of all my happiness ! oh , sire , forgive me , forgive me ! for pity 's sake forgive me ! " be by nature a kind-hearted man . his feeling be touch , and his pride also be flatter by the abasement of this beautiful and haughty woman . his other favourite have be amiable to all , but this one be so proud , so unyielding , until she feel his . his face soften somewhat in its expression as he glance at her , but he shake his head , and his voice be as firm as ever as he answer . " it be useless , madame , " say he . " i have think this matter over for a long time , and your madness have only hurry what must in any case have take place . you must leave the palace . " " i will leave the palace . say only that you forgive me . oh , sire , i can bear your anger . it crush me down . i be not strong enough . it be not banishment , it be death to which you sentence me . think of our long year of love , sire , and say that you forgive me . i have give up all for your , honour , everything . oh , will you not give your anger up for mine ? , he weep ! oh , i be save , i be save ! " " no , no , madame , " cry the king , dash his hand across his eye . " you see the weakness of the man , but you shall also see the firmness of the king . as to your insult , i forgive them freely , if that will make you more happy in your retirement . but i owe a duty to my subject also , and that duty be to set them an example . we have think too little of such thing . but a time have come when it be necessary to review our past life , and to prepare for that which be to come . " " ah , sire , you pain me . you be not yet in the prime of your year , and you speak as though old age be upon you . in a score of year from now it may be time for folk to say that age have make a change in your life . " the king wince . " who say so ? " he cry angrily . " oh , sire , it slip from me unawares . think no more of it . nobody say so . nobody . " " you be hide something from me . who be it who say this ? " " oh , do not ask me , sire . " " you say that it be report that i have change my life not through religion , but through stress of year . who say so ? " " oh , sire , it be but foolish court gossip , all unworthy of your attention . it be but the empty common talk of cavalier who have nothing else to say to gain a smile from their lady . " " the common talk ? " flush crimson . " have i , then , grow so age ? you have know me for nearly twenty year . do you see such change in me ? " " to me , sire , you be as please and as gracious as when you first win the heart of mademoiselle . " the king smile as he look at the beautiful woman before him . " in very truth , " say he , " i can say that there have be no such great change in mademoiselle either . but still it be good that we should part , . " " if it will add aught to your happiness , sire , i shall go through it , be it to my death . " " now that be the proper spirit . " " you have but to name the place , , , or my own convent of in the . what matter where the flower wither , when once the sun have forever turn from it ? at least , the past be my own , and i shall live in the remembrance of the day when none have come between us , and when your sweet love be all my own . be happy , sire , be happy , and think no more of what i say about the foolish gossip of the court . your life lie in the future . mine be in the past . adieu , dear sire , adieu ! " she throw forward her hand , her eye dim over , and she would have fall have not spring forward and catch her in his arm . her beautiful head droop upon his shoulder , her breath be warm upon his cheek , and the subtle scent of her hair be in his nostril . his arm , as he hold her , rise and fall with her bosom , and he feel her heart , beneath his hand , flutter like a cage bird . her broad white throat be throw back , her eye almost close , her lip just part enough to show the line of pearly tooth , her beautiful face not three inch from his own . and then suddenly the eyelid quiver , and the great blue eye look up at him , lovingly , appealingly , half deprecate , half challenging , her whole soul in a glance . do he move ? or be it she ? who could tell ? but their lip have meet in a long kiss , and then in another , and plan and resolution be stream away from like autumn leave in the west wind . " then i be not to go ? you would not have the heart to send me away , would you ? " " no , no ; but you must not annoy me , . " " i have rather die than cause you an instant of grief . oh , sire , i have see so little of you lately ! and i love you so ! it have madden me . and then that dreadful -- " " who , then ? " " oh , i must not speak against her . i will be civil for your sake even to her , the widow of old . " " yes , yes , you must be civil . i can have any unpleasantness . " " but you will stay with me , sire ? " her supple arm coil themselves round his neck . then she hold him for an instant at arm 's length to feast her eye upon his face , and then draw him once more towards her . " you will not leave me , dear sire . it be so long since you have be here . " the sweet face , the pink glow in the room , the hush of the evening , all seem to join in their sensuous influence . sink down upon the settee . " i will stay , " say he . " and that carriage , dear sire , at the east door ? " " i have be very harsh with you , . you will forgive me . have you paper and pencil , that i may countermand the order ? " " they be here , sire , upon the side table . i have also a note which , if i may leave you for an instant , i will write in the anteroom . " she sweep out with triumph in her eye . it have be a terrible fight , but all the great the credit of her victory . she take a little pink slip of paper from an inlaid desk , and dash off a few word upon it . they be : " should madame have any message for his majesty , he will be for the next few hour in the room of madame . " this she address to her rival , and it be send on the spot , together with the king 's order , by the hand of the little black page . for nearly a week the king be constant to his new humour . the routine of his life remain unchanged , save that it be the room of the frail beauty , rather than of madame , which attract him in the afternoon . and in sympathy with this sudden relapse into his old life , his coat lose something of their sombre hue , and , , and lilac begin to replace the black and the blue . a little gold lace bud out upon his hat also and at the trimming of his pocket , while for three day on end his prie-dieu at the royal chapel have be unoccupied . his walk be brisk , and he give a youthful flourish to his cane as a defiance to those who have see in his reformation the first symptom of age . madame have know her man well when she throw out that artful insinuation . and as the king brighten , so all the great court brighten too . the salon begin to resume their former splendour , and gay coat and glitter embroidery which have lie in drawer for year be see once more in the hall of the palace . in the chapel , preach in vain to empty bench , but a ballet in the ground be attend by the whole court , and receive with a frenzy of enthusiasm . the be crowd every morning with man and woman who have some suit to be urge , while her rival 's chamber be as desert as they have be before the king first turn a gracious look upon her . face which have be long banish the court begin to reappear in the corridor and garden unchecked and , while the black cassock of the jesuit and the purple soutane of the bishop be less frequent colour in the royal circle . but the party , who , if they be the champion of bigotry , be also those of virtue , be never seriously alarm at this relapse . the grave eye of priest or of prelate follow in his escapade as wary huntsman might watch a young deer which gambol about in the meadow under the impression that it be masterless , when every gap and path be net , and it be in truth as much in their hand as though it be lie bound before them . they know how short a time it would be before some ache , some pain , some chance word , would bring his mortality home to him again , and envelop him once more in those superstitious terror which take the place of religion in his mind . they wait , therefore , and they silently plan how the prodigal might good be deal with on his return . to this end it be that his confessor , , and , the great of , wait one morning upon madame in her chamber . with a globe beside her , she be endeavour to teach geography to the lame and the mischievous little , who have enough of their father 's disposition to make them averse to learn , and of their mother be to cause them to hate any discipline or restraint . her wonderful tact , however , and her patience have win the love and confidence even of these little perverse prince , and it be one of madame 's most bitter grief that not only her royal lover , but even her own child , turn away from the brilliancy and rich of her salon to pass their time in the modest apartment of her rival . madame dismiss her two pupil , and receive the ecclesiastic with the mixture of affection and respect which be due to those who be not only personal friend , but great light of the gallican church . she have suffer the minister to sit upon a stool in her presence , but the two chair be allot to the priest now , and she insist upon reserve the humble seat for herself . the last few day have cast a pallor over her face which spiritualise and refine the feature , but she wear unimpaired the expression of sweet serenity which be habitual to her . " i see , my dear daughter , that you have sorrow , " say , glance at her with a kindly and yet search eye . " i have indeed , your grace . all last night i spend in prayer that this trial may pass away from us . " " and yet you have no need for fear , , i assure you . other may think that your influence have cease ; but we , who know the king 's heart , we think otherwise . a few day may pass , a few week at the most , and once more it will be upon your rise fortune that every eye in will turn . " the lady 's brow cloud , and she glance at the prelate as though his speech be not altogether to her taste . " i trust that pride do not lead me astray , " she say . " but if i can read my own soul aright , there be no thought of myself in the grief which now tear my heart . what be power to me ? what do i desire ? a little room , leisure for my devotion , a pittance to save me from more can i ask for ? why , then , should i covet power ? if i be sore at heart , it be not for any poor loss which i have sustain . i think no more of it than of the snap of one of the thread on yonder tapestry frame . it be for the king i the noble heart , the kindly soul , which might rise so high , and which be drag so low , like a royal eagle with some foul weight which ever hamper its flight . it be for him and for that my day be spend in sorrow and my night upon my knee . " " for all that , my daughter , you be ambitious . " it be the jesuit who have speak . his voice be clear and cold , and his piercing gray eye seem to read into the depth of her soul . " you may be right , father . guard me from self-esteem . and yet i do not think that i be . the king , in his goodness , have offer me -- i have refuse them ; have return it . he have deign to ask my advice in matter of state , and i have withhold it . where , then , be my ambition ? " " in your heart , my daughter . but it be not a sinful ambition . it be not an ambition of this world . would you not love to turn the king towards good ? " " i would give my life for it . " " and there be your ambition . ah , can i not read your noble soul ? would you not love to see the reign pure and serene over all this see the poor house , the needy help , the wicked turn from their way , and the king ever the leader in all that be noble and good ? would you not love that , my daughter ? " her cheek have flush , and her eye shine as she look at the gray face of the jesuit , and see the picture which his word have conjure up before her . " ah , that would be joy indeed ! " she cry . " and great joy still to know , not from the mouth of the people , but from the voice of your own heart in the privacy of your chamber , that you have be the cause of it , that your influence have bring this blessing upon the king and upon the country . " " i would die to do it . " " we wish you to do what may be hard . we wish you to live to do it . " " ah ! " she glance from one to the other with question eye . " my daughter , " say solemnly , lean forward , with his broad white hand outstretch and his purple pastoral ring sparkle in the sunlight , " it be time for plain speaking . it be in the interest of the church that we do it . none hear , and none shall ever hear , what pass between us now . regard us , if you will , as two confessor , with whom your secret be inviolable . i call it a secret , and yet it be none to us , for it be our mission to read the human heart . you love the king . " " your grace ! " she start , and a warm blush , mantle up in her pale cheek , deepen and spread until it tint her white forehead and her queenly neck . " you love the king . " " your ! " she turn in confusion from one to the other . " there be no shame in loving , my daughter . the shame lie only in yield to love . i say again that you love the king . " " at least i have never tell him so , " she falter . " and will you never ? " " heaven wither my tongue first ! " " but consider , my daughter . such love in a soul like yours be heaven 's gift , and send for some wise purpose . this human love be too often but a noxious weed which blight the soil it grow in , but here it be a gracious flower , all fragrant with humility and virtue . " " alas ! i have try to tear it from my heart . " " ; rather hold it firmly root there . do the king but meet with some tenderness from you , some sign that his own affection meet with an answer from your heart , it might be that this ambition which you profess would be secure , and that , strengthen by the intimate companionship of your noble nature , might live in the spirit as well as in the form of the . all this might spring from the love which you hide away as though it bear the brand of shame . " the lady half rise , glance from the prelate to the priest with eye which have a lurk horror in their depth . " can i have understand you ! " she gasp . " what meaning lie behind these word ? you can counsel me -- " the jesuit have rise , and his spare figure towered above her . " my daughter , we give no counsel which be unworthy of our office . we speak for the interest of , and those interest demand that you should marry the king . " " marry the king ! " the little room swim round her . " marry the king ! " " there lie the good hope for the future . we see in you a second , who will save both and 's king . " madame sit silent for a few moment . her face have regain its composure , and her eye be bend vacantly upon her tapestry frame as she turn over in her mind all that be involve in the suggestion . " but this could never be , " she say at last , " why should we plan that which can never come to pass ? " " and why ? " " what king of have marry a subject ? see how every princess of stretch out her hand to him . the of must be of queenly blood , even as the last be . " " all this may be overcome . " " and then there be the reason of state . if the king marry , it should be to form a powerful alliance , to cement a friendship with a neighbour nation , or to gain some province which may be the bride 's dowry . what be my dowry ? a widow 's pension and a work-box . " she laugh bitterly , and yet glance eagerly at her companion , as one who wish to be confute . " your dowry , my daughter , would be those gift of body and of mind with which heaven have endow you . the king have money enough , and the king have province enough . as to the state , how can the state be well serve than by the assurance that the king will be save in future from such sight as be to be see in this palace ? " " oh , if it could be so ! but think , father , think of those about -- the dauphin , monsieur his brother , his minister . you know how little this would please them , and how easy it be for them to sway his mind . no , no ; it be a dream , father , and it can never be . " the face of the two ecclesiastic , who have dismiss her other objection with a smile and a wave , cloud over at this , as though she have at last touch upon the real obstacle . " my daughter , " say the jesuit gravely , " that be a matter which you may leave to the church . it may be that we , too , have some power over the king 's mind , and that we may lead him in the right path , even though those of his own blood would fain have it otherwise . the future only can show with whom the power lie . but you ? love and duty both draw you one way now , and the may count upon you . " " to my last breath , father . " " and you upon the . it will serve you , if you in turn will but serve it . " " what high wish could i have ? " " you will be our daughter , our queen , our champion , and you will heal the wound of the suffering church . " " ah ! if i could ! " " but you can . while there be heresy within the land there can be no peace or rest for the faithful . it be the speck of mould which will in time , if it be not pare off , corrupt the whole fruit . " " what would you have , then , father ? " " the huguenot must go . they must be drive forth . the goat must be divide from the sheep . the king be already in two mind . be our friend now . if you be with us , then all will be well . " " but , father , think how many there be ! " " the more reason that they should be deal with . " " and think , too , of their suffering should they be drive forth . " " their cure lie in their own hand . " " that be true . and yet my heart soften for them . " and the bishop shake their head . have make them both kind and charitable man , but the heart turn to flint when the blessing of religion be change to the curse of sect . " you would befriend 's enemy then ? " " no , no ; not if they be indeed so . " " can you doubt it ? be it possible that your heart still turn towards the heresy of your youth ? " " no , father ; but it be not in nature to forget that my father and my -- " " , they have answer for their own sin . be it possible that the have be mistake in you ? do you then refuse the first favour which she ask of you ? you would accept her aid , and yet you would give none in return . " madame rise with the air of one who have make her resolution . " you be wise than i , " say she , " and to you have be commit the interest of the . i will do what you advise . " " you promise it ? " " i do . " her two visitor throw up their hand together . " it be a blessed day , " they cry , " and generation yet unborn will learn to deem it so . " she sit half stun by the prospect which be open out in front of her . ambitious she have , as the jesuit have surmise , always -- ambitious for the power which would enable her to leave the world well than she find it . and this ambition she have already to some extent be able to satisfy , for more than once she have sway both king and kingdom . but to marry the marry the man for whom she would gladly lay down her life , whom in the depth of her heart she love in as pure and as noble a fashion as woman ever yet love be indeed a thing above her utmost hope . she know her own mind , and she know his . once his wife , she could hold him to good , and keep every evil influence away from him . she be sure of it . she should be no weak , but rather , as the priest have say , a new , come to lead and 's king into good way . and if , to gain this aim , she have to harden her heart against the huguenot , at least the fault , if there be one , lie with those who make this condition rather than with herself . the king 's wife ! the heart of the woman and the soul of the enthusiast both leap at the thought . but close at the heel of her joy there come a sudden revulsion to doubt and despondency . be not all this fine prospect a mere day-dream ? and how could these man be so sure that they hold the king in the hollow of their hand ? the jesuit read the fear which dull the sparkle of her eye , and answer her thought before she have time to put them into word . " the redeem its pledge swiftly , " say he . " and you , my daughter , you must be as prompt when your own turn come . " " i have promise , father . " " then it be for us to perform . you will remain in your room all evening . " " yes , father . " " the king already hesitate . i speak with him this morning , and his mind be full of blackness and despair . his good self turn in disgust from his sin , and it be now when the first hot fit of repentance be just come upon him that he may well be mould to our end . i have to see and speak with him once more , and i go from your room to his . and when i have speak , he will come from his room to yours , or i have study his heart for twenty year in vain . we leave you now , and you will not see us , but you will see the effect of what we do , and you will remember your pledge to us . " they bow low to her both together , and leave her to her thought . an hour pass , and then a second one , as she sit in her fauteuil , her tapestry before her , but her hand listless upon her lap , wait for her fate . her life 's future be now be settle for her , and she be powerless to turn it in one way or the other . daylight turn to the pearly light of evening , and that again to dusk , but she still sit wait in the shadow . sometimes as a step pass in the corridor she would glance expectantly towards the door , and the light of welcome would spring up in her gray eye , only to die away again into disappointment . at last , however , there come a quick sharp tread , crisp and authoritative , which bring her to her foot with flush cheek and her heart beating wildly . the door open , and she see outline against the gray light of the outer passage the erect and graceful figure of the king . " sire ! one instant , and mademoiselle will light the lamp . " " do not call her . " he enter and close the door behind him . " , the dusk be welcome to me , because it screen me from the reproach which must lie in your glance , even if your tongue be too kindly to speak them . " " reproach , sire ! forbid that i should utter them ! " " when i last leave you , , it be with a good resolution in my mind . i try to carry it out , and i fail . i remember that you warn me . fool that i be not to follow your advice ! " " we be all weak and mortal , sire . who have not fall ? , sire , it go to my heart to see you thus . " he be stand by the fireplace , his face bury in his hand , and she could tell by the catch of his breath that he be weep . all the pity of her woman 's nature go out to that silent and repent figure dimly see in the fail light . she put out her hand with a gesture of sympathy , and it rest for an instant upon his velvet sleeve . the next he have clasp it between his own , and she make no effort to release it . " i can do without you , , " he cry . " i be the lonely man in all this world , like one who live on a great , with none to bear him company . who have i for a friend ? whom can i rely upon ? some be for the ; some be for their family ; most be for themselves . but who of them all be single-minded ? you be my good self , ; you be my guardian angel . what the good father say be true , and the near i be to you the further be i from all that be evil . tell me , , do you love me ? " " i have love you for year , sire . " her voice be low but voice of a woman to whom coquetry be abhorrent . " i have hope it , , and yet it thrill me to hear you say it . i know that wealth and title have no attraction for you , and that your heart turn rather towards the convent than the palace . yet i ask you to remain in the palace , and to reign there . will you be my wife , ? " and so the moment have in very truth come . she pause for an instant , only an instant , before take this last great step ; but even that be too long for the patience of the king . " will you not , ? " he cry , with a ring of fear in his voice . " make me worthy of such an honour , sire ! " say she . " and here i swear that if heaven double my life , every hour shall be spend in the one endeavour to make you a happy man ! " she have kneel down , and the king , still hold her hand , kneel down beside her . " and i swear too , " he cry , " that if my day also be double , you will now and forever be the one and only woman for me . " and so their double oath be take , an oath which be to be test in the future , for each do live almost double their year , and yet neither break the promise make hand in hand on that evening in the chamber . it may have be that mademoiselle , the faithful confidante of madame , have learn something of this interview , or it may be that , with the shrewdness for which his order be famous , have come to the conclusion that publicity be the good mean of hold the king to his present intention ; but whatever the source , it be know all over the court next day that the old favourite be again in disgrace , and that there be talk of a marriage between the king and the governess of his child . it be whisper at the petit lever , confirm at the grand entree , and be common gossip by the time that the king have return from chapel . back into wardrobe and drawer go the flare silk and the feather hat , and out once more come the sombre coat and the matronly dress . and give place to the missal and a , while , after preach for a week to empty bench , find his chapel pack to the last seat with weary gentleman and lady . by midday there be none in the court who have not hear the tidings , save only madame , who , alarm by her lover 's absence , have remain in haughty seclusion in her room , and know nothing of what have pass . many there be who would have love to carry her the tidings ; but the king 's change have be frequent of late , and who would dare to make a mortal enemy of one who might , ere many week be past , have the life and fortune of the whole court in the hollow of her hand ? , in his innate selfishness , have be so accustom to regard every event entirely from the side of how it would affect himself , that it have never strike him that his long-suffering family , who have always yield to him the absolute obedience which he claim as his right , would venture to offer any opposition to his new resolution . he be surprise , therefore , when his brother demand a private interview that afternoon , and enter his presence without the complaisant smile and humble air with which he be wont to appear before him . monsieur be a curious travesty of his elder brother . he be short , but he wear enormously high , which bring him to a fair stature . in figure he have none of that grace which mark the king , nor have he the elegant hand and foot which have be the delight of sculptor . he be fat , waddle somewhat in his walk , and wear an enormous black wig , which roll down in row and row of curl over his shoulder . his face be long and dark than the king 's , and his nose more prominent , though he share with his brother the large brown eye which each have inherit from of . he have none of the simple and yet stately taste which mark the dress of the monarch , but his clothes be all tag over with flutter ribbon , which rustle behind him as he walk , and cluster so thickly over his foot as to conceal them from view . crosse , star , jewel , and insignia be scatter broadcast over his person , and the broad blue ribbon of the order of the be slash across his coat , and be gather at the end into a great bow , which form the incongruous support of a sword . such be the figure which roll towards the king , bear in his right hand his beaver , and appear in his person , as he be in his mind , an absurd burlesque of the monarch . " why , monsieur , you seem less gay than usual , " say the king , with a smile . " your dress , indeed , be bright , but your brow be cloud . i trust that all be well with madame and with the ? " " yes , sire , they be well ; but they be sad like myself , and from the same cause . " " indeed ! and why ? " " have i ever fail in my duty as your young brother , sire ? " " never , , never ! " say the king , lay his hand affectionately upon the other 's shoulder . " you have set an excellent example to my subject . " " then why set a slight upon me ? " " ! " " yes , sire , i say it be a slight . we be of royal blood , and our wife be of royal blood also . you marry the of ; i marry the of . it be a condescension , but still i do it . my first wife be the of . how can we admit into a house which have form such alliance as these a woman who be the widow of a hunchback singer , a mere lampooner , a man whose name be a byword through ? " the king have stare in amazement at his brother , but his anger now overcome his astonishment . " upon my word ! " he cry ; " upon my word ! i have say just now that you have be an excellent brother , but i fear that i speak a little prematurely . and so you take upon yourself to object to the lady whom i select as my wife ! " " i do , sire . " " and by what right ? " " by the right of the family honour , sire , which be as much mine as yours . " " man , " cry the king furiously , " have you not yet learn that within this kingdom i be the fountain of honour , and that i may honour become by that very fact honourable ? be i to take a out of the , i could at my will raise her up until the high in would be proud to bow down before her . do you not know this ? " " no , i do not , " cry his brother , with all the obstinacy of a weak man who have at last be drive to bay . " i look upon it as a slight upon me and a slight upon my wife . " " your wife ! i have every respect for of , but how be she superior to one whose grandfather be the dear friend and comrade in arm of the ? enough ! i will not condescend to argue such a matter with you ! , and do not return to my presence until you have learn not to interfere in my affair . " " for all that , my wife shall not know her ! " snarl monsieur ; and then , as his brother take a fiery step or two towards him , he turn and scuttle out of the room as fast as his awkward gait and high heel would allow him . but the king be to have no quiet that day . if madame 's friend have rally to her yesterday , her enemy be active . monsieur have hardly disappear before there rush into the room a youth who bear upon his rich attire every sign of have just arrive from a dusty journey . he be and , with feature which would have be strikingly like the king be if it be not that his nose have be disfigure in his youth . the king 's face have light up at the sight of him , but it darken again as he hurry forward and throw himself down at his foot . " oh , sire , " he cry , " spare us this us this humiliation ! i implore you to pause before you do what will bring dishonour upon yourself and upon us ! " the king start back from him , and pace angrily up and down the room . " this be intolerable ! " he cry . " it be bad from my brother , but bad from my son . you be in a conspiracy with him , . monsieur have tell you to act this part . " the dauphin rise to his foot and look steadfastly at his angry father . " i have not see my uncle , " he say . " i be at when i hear this dreadful i spring upon my horse , sire , and gallop over to implore you to think again before you drag our royal house so low . " " you be insolent , . " " i do not mean to be so , sire . but consider , sire , that my mother be a queen , and that it would be strange indeed if for a i have -- " the king raise his hand with a gesture of authority which check the word upon his lip . " silence ! " he cry , " or you may say that which would for ever set a gulf between us . be i to be treat bad than my humble subject , who be allow to follow his own bent in his private affair ? " " this be not your own private affair , sire ; all that you do reflect upon your family . the great deed of your reign have give a new glory to the name of bourbon . oh , do not mar it now , sire ! i implore it of you upon my knee ! " " you talk like a fool ! " cry his father roughly . " i propose to marry a virtuous and charming lady of one of the old noble family of , and you talk as if i be do something degrading and unheard of . what be your objection to this lady ? " " that she be the daughter of a man whose vice be well know , that her brother be of the bad repute , that she have lead the life of an adventuress , be the widow of a deformed scribbler , and that she occupy a menial position in the palace . " the king have stamp with his foot upon the carpet more than once during this frank address , but his anger blaze into a fury at its conclusion . " do you dare , " he cry , with flash eye , " to call the charge of my child a menial position ? i say that there be no high in the kingdom . go back to , sir , this instant , and never dare to open your mouth again on the subject . away , i say ! when , in 's good time , you be king of this country , you may claim your own way , but until then do not venture to cross the plan of one who be both your parent and your monarch . " the young man bow low , and walk with dignity from the chamber ; but he turn with his hand upon the door . " the come with me , sire . be it your pleasure to see him ? " " away ! away ! " cry the king furiously , still stride up and down the room with angry face and flash eye . the dauphin leave the cabinet , and be instantly succeed by a tall thin priest , some forty year of age , strikingly handsome , with a pale refined face , large well-marked feature , and the easy deferential bearing of one who have have a long training in court . the king turn sharply upon him , and look hard at him with a distrustful eye . " , , " say he . " may i ask what the object of this interview be ? " " you have have the condescension , sire , on more than one occasion , to ask my humble advice , and even to express yourself afterwards as be please that you have act upon it . " " well ? well ? well ? " growl the monarch . " if rumour say truly , sire , you be now at a crisis when a word of impartial counsel might be of value to you . need i say that it -- " " ! tut ! why all these word ? " cry the king . " you have be send here by other to try and influence me against madame . " " sire , i have have nothing but kindness from that lady . i esteem and honour her more than any lady in . " " in that case , , you will , i be sure , be glad to hear that i be about to marry her . , . i regret that i have not long time to devote to this very interesting conversation . " " but , -- " " when my mind be in doubt , , i value your advice very highly . on this occasion my mind be happily not in doubt . i have the honour to wish you a very . " the king 's first hot anger have die away by now , and have leave behind it a cold , bitter spirit which be even more formidable to his antagonist . the , glib of tongue and fertile of resource as he be , feel himself to be silence and overmatch . he walk backwards , with three long bow , as be the custom of the court , and depart . but the king have little breathing space . his assailant know that with persistence they have bend his will before , and they trust that they might do so again . it be , the minister , now who enter the room , with his majestic port , his lofty bearing , his huge wig , and his aristocratic face , which , however , show some sign of trepidation as it meet the baleful eye of the king . " well , , what now ? " he ask impatiently . " have some new state matter arise ? " " there be but one new state matter which have arise , sire , but it be of such importance as to banish all other from our mind . " " what then ? " " your marriage , sire . " " you disapprove of it ? " " oh , sire , can i help it ? " " out of my room , sir ! be i to be torment to death by your importunity ? what ! you dare to linger when i order you to go ! " the king advance angrily upon the minister , but suddenly flash out his rapier . spring back with alarm and amazement upon his face , but it be the hilt and not the point which be present to him . " pass it through my heart , sire ! " the minister cry , fall upon his knee , his whole great frame in a quiver with emotion . " i will not live to see your glory fade ! " " great heaven ! " shriek , throw the sword down upon the ground , and raise his hand to his temple , " i believe that this be a conspiracy to drive me mad . be ever a man so torment in his life ? this will be a private marriage , man , and it will not affect the state in the least degree . do you hear me ? have you understand me ? what more do you want ? " gather himself up , and shoot his rapier back into its sheath . " your majesty be determine ? " he ask . " absolutely . " " then i say no more . i have do my duty . " he bow his head as one in deep dejection when he depart , but in truth his heart be lighten within him , for he have the king 's assurance that the woman whom he hate would , even though his wife , not sit on the throne of the of . these repeated attack , if they have not shake the king 's resolution , have at least irritated and exasperate him to the utmost . such a blast of opposition be a new thing to a man whose will have be the one law of the land . it leave him ruffle and disturb , and without regret his resolution , he still , with unreasoning petulance , feel incline to visit the inconvenience to which he have be put upon those whose advice he have follow . he wear accordingly no very cordial face when the usher in attendance admit the venerable figure of , his confessor . " i wish you all happiness , sire , " say the jesuit , " and i congratulate you from my heart that you have take the great step which must lead to content both in this world and the next . " " i have have neither happiness nor contentment yet , father , " answer the king peevishly . " i have never be so pester in my life . the whole court have be on its knee to me to entreat me to change my intention . " the jesuit look at him anxiously out of his keen gray eye . " fortunately , your majesty be a man of strong will , " say he , " and not to be so easily sway as they think . " " no , no , i do not give an inch . but still , it must be confess that it be very unpleasant to have so many against one . i think that most man would have be shake . " " now be the time to stand firm , sire ; satan rage to see you pass out of his power , and he stir up all his friend and send all his emissary to endeavour to detain you . " but the king be not in a humour to be easily console . " upon my word , father , " say he , " you do not seem to have much respect for my family . my brother and my son , with the and the of , be the emissary to whom you allude . " " then there be the more credit to your majesty for have resist them . you have do nobly , sire . you have earn the praise and blessing of . " " i trust that what i have do be right , father , " say the king gravely . " i should be glad to see you again later in the evening , but at present i desire a little leisure for solitary thought . " leave the cabinet with a deep distrust of the king 's intention . it be obvious that the powerful appeal which have be make to him have shake if they have fail to alter his resolution . what would be the result if more be make ? and more would be make ; that be as certain as that darkness follow light . some must be play now which would bring the matter to a crisis at once , for every day of delay be in favour of their opponent . to hesitate be to lose . all must be stake upon one final throw . the of be wait in the , and in a few brief word let him see the danger of the situation and the mean by which they should meet it . together they seek madame in her room . she have discard the sombre widow 's dress which she have choose since her first come to court , and wear now , as more in keep with her lofty prospect , a rich yet simple costume of white satin with bow of silver serge . a single diamond sparkle in the thick coil of her dark tress . the change have take year from a face and figure which have always look much young than her age , and as the two plotter look upon her perfect complexion , her regular feature , so calm and yet so full of refinement , and the exquisite grace of her figure and bearing , they could not but feel that if they fail in their end , it be not for want of have a perfect tool at their command . she have rise at their entrance , and her expression show that she have read upon their face something of the anxiety which fill their mind . " you have evil news ! " she cry . " no , no , my daughter . " it be the bishop who speak . " but we must be on our guard against our enemy , who would turn the king away from you if they could . " her face shine at the mention of her lover . " ah , you do not know ! " she cry . " he have make a vow . i would trust him as i would trust myself . i know that he will be true . " but the jesuit 's intellect be array against the intuition of the woman . " our opponent be many and strong , " say he shake his head . " even if the king remain firm , he will be annoy at every turn , so that he will feel his life be dark instead of lighter , save , of course , madame , for that brightness which you can fail to bring with you . we must bring the matter to an end . " " and how , father ? " " the marriage must be at once ! " " at once ! " " yes . this very night , if possible . " " oh , father , you ask too much . the king would never consent to such a proposal . " " it be he that will propose it . " " and why ? " " because we shall force him to . it be only thus that all the opposition can be stop . when it be do , the court will accept it . until it be do , they will resist it . " " what would you have me do , then , father ? " " resign the king . " " resign him ! " she turn as pale as a lily , and look at him in bewilderment . " it be the good course , madame . " " ah , father , i might have do it last month , last week , even yesterday morning . but , it would break my heart ! " " fear not , madame . we advise you for the good . go to the king now , at once . say to him that you have hear that he have be subject to much annoyance upon your account , that you can bear to think that you should be a cause of dissension in his own family , and therefore you will release him from his promise , and will withdraw yourself from the court forever . " " go now ? at once ? " " yes , without loss of an instant . " she cast a light mantle about her shoulder . " i follow your advice , " she say . " i believe that you be wise than but , oh , if he should take me at my word ! " " he will not take you at your word . " " it be a terrible risk . " " but such an end as this can be gain without risk . go , my child , and may heaven 's blessing go with you ! " the king have remain alone in his cabinet , wrap in somewhat gloomy thought , and ponder over the means by which he might carry out his purpose and yet smooth away the opposition which seem to be so strenuous and so universal . suddenly there come a gentle tap at the door , and there be the woman who be in his thought , stand in the twilight before him . he spring to his foot and hold out his hand with a smile which would have reassure her have she doubt his constancy . " ! you here ! then i have at last a welcome visitor , and it be the first one . " " sire , i fear that you have be trouble . " " i have indeed , . " " but i have a remedy for it . " " and what be that ? " " i shall leave the court , sire , and you shall think no more of what have pass between us . i have bring discord where i mean to bring peace . let me retire to , or to the of , and you will no longer be call upon to make such sacrifice for my sake . " the king turn deathly pale , and clutch at her shawl with a tremble hand , as though he fear that she be about to put her resolution into effect that very instant . for year his mind have accustom itself to lean upon hers . he have turn to her whenever he need support , and even when , as in the last week , he have break away from her for a time , it be still all-important to him to know that she be there , the faithful friend , ever forgiving , ever soothing , wait for him with her ready counsel and sympathy . but that she should leave him now , leave him altogether , such a thought have never occur to him , and it strike him with a chill of surprised alarm . " you can mean it , , " he cry , in a tremble voice . " no , no , it be impossible that you be in earnest . " " it would break my heart to leave you , sire , but it break it also to think that for my sake you be estrange from your own family and minister . " " tut ! be i not the king ? shall i not take my own course without heed to them ? no , no , , you must not leave me ! you must stay with me and be my wife . " he could hardly speak for agitation , and he still grasp at her dress to detain her . she have be precious to him before , but be far more so now that there seem to be a possibility of his lose her . she feel the strength of her position , and use it to the utmost . " some time must elapse before our wedding , sire . yet during all that interval you will be expose to these annoyance . how can i be happy when i feel that i have bring upon you so long a period of discomfort ? " " and why should it be so long , ? " " a day would be too long , sire , for you to be unhappy through my fault . it be a misery to me to think of it . believe me , it would be well that i should leave you . " " never ! you shall not ! why should we even wait a day , ? i be ready . you be ready . why should we not be marry now ? " " at once ! oh , sire ! " " we shall . it be my wish . it be my order . that be my answer to those who would drive me . they shall know nothing of it until it be do , and then let us see which of them will dare to treat my wife with anything but respect . let it be do secretly , . i will send in a trusty messenger this very night for the archbishop of , and i swear that , if all stand in the way , he shall make us man and wife before he depart . " " be it your will , sire ? " " it be ; and , i can see by your eye that it be yours also ! we shall not lose a moment , . what a bless thought of mine , which will silence their tongue forever ! when it be ready they may know , but not before . to your room , then , dear of friend and true of woman ! when we meet again , it will be to form a bond which all this court and all this kingdom shall not be able to loose . " the king be all on fire with the excitement of this new resolution . he have lose his air of doubt and discontent , and he pace swiftly about the room with a smile face and shine eye . then he touch a small gold bell , which summon , his private body-servant . " what o'clock be it , ? " " it be nearly six , sire . " " hum ! " the king consider for some moment . " do you know where be , ? " " he be in the ground , sire , but i hear that he would ride back to . " " do he ride alone ? " " he have one friend with him . " " who be this friend ? an officer of the guard ? " " no , sire ; it be a stranger from over the sea , from , as i understand , who have stay with him of late , and to whom monsieur have be show the wonder of your 's palace . " " a stranger ! so much the well . go , , and bring them both to me . " " i trust that they have not start , sire . i will see . " he hurry off , and be back in ten minute in the cabinet once more . " well ? " " i have be fortunate , sire . their horse have be lead out and their foot be in the stirrup when i reach them . " " where be they , then ? " " they await your 's order in the . " " show them in , , and give admission to none , not even to the minister , until they have leave me . " to an audience with the monarch be a common incident of his duty , but it be with profound astonishment that he learn from that his friend and companion be include in the order . he be eagerly endeavour to whisper into the young 's ear some precept and warning as to what to do and what to avoid , when reappear and usher them into the presence . it be with a feeling of curiosity , not unmixed with awe , that , to whom , of , have be the high embodiment of human power , enter the private chamber of the great monarch in . the magnificence of the in which he have wait , the velvet , the painting , the gilding , with the throng of gaily dress official and of magnificent guardsman , have all impress his imagination , and have prepare him for some wondrous figure robe and crown , a fit centre for such a scene . as his eye fall upon a quietly dress , bright-eyed man , half a head short than himself , with a trim dapper figure , and an erect carriage , he could not help glance round the room to see if this be indeed the monarch , or if it be some other of those endless official who interpose themselves between him and the other world . the reverent salute of his companion , however , show him that this must indeed be the king , so he bow and then draw himself erect with the simple dignity of a man who have be train in 's school . " , , " say the king , with a pleasant smile . " your friend , as i understand , be a stranger to this country . i trust , sir , that you have find something here to interest and to amuse you ? " " yes , your majesty . i have see your great city , and it be a wonderful one . and my friend have show me this palace , with its wood and its ground . when i go back to my own country i will have much to say of what i have see in your beautiful land . " " you speak french , and yet you be not a canadian . " " no , sire ; i be from the english province . " the king look with interest at the powerful figure , the bold feature , and the free bearing of the young foreigner , and his mind flash back to the danger which the have foretell from these same colony . if this be indeed a type of his race , they must in truth be a people whom it would be good to have as friend than as enemy . his mind , however , run at present on other thing than statecraft , and he hasten to give his order for the night . " you will ride into on my service . your friend can go with you . two be safe than one when they bear a message of state . i wish you , however , to wait until nightfall before you start . " " yes , sire . " " let none know your errand , and see that none follow you . you know the house of , prelate of ? " " yes , sire . " " you will bid him drive out hither and be at the side postern by midnight . let nothing hold him back . storm or fine , he must he here . it be of the first importance . " " he shall have your order , sire . " " very good . adieu , captain . adieu , monsieur . i trust that your stay in may be a pleasant one . " he wave his hand , smile with the fascinating grace which have win so many heart , and so dismiss the two friend to their new mission . madame still keep to her room , uneasy in mind at the king 's disappearance , but unwilling to show her anxiety to the court by appear among them or by make any inquiry as to what have occur . while she thus remain in ignorance of the sudden and complete collapse of her fortune , she have one active and energetic agent who have lose no incident of what have occur , and who watch her interest with as much zeal as if they be his own . and indeed they be his own ; for her brother , monsieur , have gain everything for which he yearn , money , land , and preferment , through his sister 's notoriety , and he well know that the fall of her fortune must be very rapidly follow by that of his own . by nature bold , unscrupulous , and resourceful , he be not a man to lose the game without play it out to the very end with all the energy and cunning of which he be capable . keenly alert to all that pass , he have , from the time that he first hear the rumour of the king 's intention , haunt the antechamber and draw his own conclusion from what he have see . nothing have escape disconsolate face of monsieur and of the dauphin , the visit of and to the lady 's room , her return , the triumph which shine in her eye as she come away from the interview . he have see hurry off and summon the guardsman and his friend . he have hear them order their horse to be bring out in a couple of hour ' time , and finally , from a spy whom he employ among the servant , he learn that an unwonted bustle be go forward in madame 's room , that mademoiselle be half wild with excitement , and that two court milliner have be hastily summon to madame 's apartment . it be only , however , when he hear from the same servant that a chamber be to be prepare for the reception that night of the archbishop of that he understand how urgent be the danger . madame have spend the evening stretch upon a sofa , in the bad possible humour with everyone around her . she have read , but have toss aside the book . she have write , but have tear up the paper . a thousand fear and suspicion chase each other through her head . what have become of the king , then ? he have seem cold yesterday , and his eye have be for ever slide round to the clock . and he have not come at all . be it his gout , perhaps ? or be it possible that she be again lose her hold upon him ? surely it could not be that ! she turn upon her couch and face the mirror which flank the door . the candle have just be light in her chamber , two score of them , each with silver back which reflect their light until the room be as bright as day . there in the mirror be the brilliant chamber , the deep red ottoman , and the single figure in its gauzy dress of white and silver . she lean upon her elbow , admire the deep tint of her own eye with their long dark lash , the white curve of her throat , and the perfect oval of her face . she examine it all carefully , keenly , as though it be her rival that lie before her , but nowhere could she see a scratch of 's malicious nail . she still have her beauty , then . and if it have once win the king , why should it not suffice to hold him ? of course it would do so . she reproach herself for her fear . doubtless he be indispose , or perhaps he would come still . ! there be the sound of an opening door and of a quick step in her . be it he , or at least his messenger with a note from him ? but no , it be her brother , with the haggard eye and draw face of a man who be weigh down with his own evil tidings . he turn as he enter , fasten the door , and then stride across the room , lock the other one which lead to her boudoir . " we be safe from interruption , " he pant . " i have hasten here , for every second may be invaluable . have you hear anything from the king ? " " nothing . " she have spring to her foot , and be gaze at him with a face which be as pale as his own . " the hour have come for action , . it be the hour at which the have always show at their good . do not yield to the blow , then , but gather yourself to meet it . " " what be it ? " she try to speak in her natural tone , but only a whisper come to her dry lip . " the king be about to marry madame . " " the ! the widow ! it be impossible ! " " it be certain . " " to marry ? do you say to marry ? " " yes , he will marry her . " the woman fling out her hand in a gesture of contempt , and laugh loud and bitterly . " you be easily frightened , brother , " say she . " ah , you do not know your little sister . perchance if you be not my brother you might rate my power more highly . give me a day , only one little day , and you will see , the proud , down at the hem of my dress to ask my pardon for this slight . i tell you that he can break the bond that hold him . one day be all i ask to bring him back . " " but you can have it . " " what ? " " the marriage be . " " you be mad , . " " i be certain of it . " in a few break sentence he shoot out all that he have see and hear . she listen with a grim face , and hand which close ever tight and tight as he proceed . but he have say the truth about the . they come of a contentious blood , and be ever at their good at a moment of action . hate rather than dismay fill her heart as she listen , and the whole energy of her nature gather and quicken to meet the crisis . " i shall go and see him , " she cry , sweep towards the door . " no , no , . believe me , you will ruin everything if you do . strict order have be give to the guard to admit no one to the king . " " but i shall insist upon pass them . " " believe me , sister , it be bad than useless . i have speak with the officer of the guard , and the command be a stringent one . " " ah , i shall manage . " " no , you shall not . " he put his back against the door . " i know that it be useless , and i will not have my sister make herself the laughing-stock of the court , try to force her way into the room of a man who repulse her . " his sister 's cheek flush at the word , and she pause irresolute . " have i only a day , , i be sure that i could bring him back to me . there have be some other influence here , that meddlesome jesuit or the pompous , perhaps . only one day to counteract their wile ! can i not see them wave before his foolish eye , as one swing a torch before a bull to turn it ? oh , if i could but baulk them ! that woman ! that cursed woman ! the foul viper which i nurse in my bosom ! oh , i have rather see in his grave than marry to her ! , , it must be stop ; i say it must be stop ! i will give anything , everything , to prevent it ! " " what will you give , my sister ? " she look at him aghast . " what ! you do not wish me to buy you ? " she say . " no ; but i wish to buy other . " " ! you see a chance , then ? " " one , and one only . but time press . i want money . " " how much ? " " i can have too much . all that you can spare . " with hand which tremble with eagerness she unlock a secret cupboard in the wall in which she conceal her valuable . a blaze of jewellery meet her brother 's eye as he peer over her shoulder . great ruby , costly emerald , deep ruddy beryl , glimmer diamond , be scatter there in one brilliant shimmer heap , the harvest which she have reap from the king 's generosity during more than fifteen year . at one side be three drawer , the one over the other . she draw out the low one . it be full to the brim of glitter louis " take what you will ! " she say . " and now your plan ! quick ! " he stuff the money in handful into the side pocket of his coat . coin slip between his finger and tinkle and wheel over the floor , but neither cast a glance at them . " your plan ? " she repeat . " we must prevent the archbishop from arrive here . then the marriage would be postpone until night , and you would have time to act . " " but how prevent it ? " " there be a dozen good rapier about the court which be to be buy for less than i carry in one pocket . there be , young , old , , and the four . i will gather them together , and wait on the road . " " and waylay the archbishop ? " " no ; the messenger . " " oh , excellent ! you be a prince of brother ! if no message reach , we be save . go ; go ; do not lose a moment , my dear . " " it be very well , ; but what be we to do with them when we get them ? we may lose our head over the matter , it seem to me . after all , they be the king 's messenger , and we can scarce pass our sword through them . " " no ? " " there would be no forgiveness for that . " " but consider that before the matter be look into i shall have regain my influence with the king . " " all very fine , my little sister , but how long be your influence to last ? a pleasant life for us if at every change of favour we have to fly the country ! no , no , ; the most that we can do be to detain the messenger . " " where can you detain them ? " " i have an idea . there be the castle of the at . " " of my husband ! " " precisely . " " of my most bitter enemy ! oh , , you be not serious . " " on the contrary , i be never more so . the marquis be away in yesterday , and have not yet return . where be the ring with his arm ? " she hunt among her jewel and pick out a gold ring with a broad engrave face . " this will be our key . when good , the steward , see it , every dungeon in the castle will be at our disposal . it be that or nothing . there be no other place where we can hold them safe . " " but when my husband return ? " " ah , he may be a little puzzle as to his captive . and the complaisant may have an evil quarter of an hour . but that may not be for a week , and by that time , my little sister , i have confidence enough in you to think that you really may have finish the campaign . not another word , for every moment be of value . adieu , ! we shall not be conquer without a struggle . i will send a message to you to let you know how fortune use us . " he take her fondly in his arm , kiss her , and then hurry from the room . for hour after his departure she pace up and down with noiseless step upon the deep soft carpet , her hand still clench , her eye flaming , her whole soul wrap and consume with jealousy and hatred of her rival . strike , and eleven , and midnight , but still she wait , fierce and eager , strain her ear for every which might be the herald of news . at last it come . she hear the quick step in the passage , the tap at the door , and the whispering of her black page . quiver with impatience , she rush in and take the note herself from the dusty cavalier who have bring it . it be but six word scrawl roughly upon a wisp of dirty paper , but it bring the colour back to her cheek and the smile to her lip . it be her brother 's writing , and it run : " the archbishop will not come . " in the meanwhile be perfectly aware of the importance of the mission which have be assign to him . the secrecy which have be enjoin by the king , his evident excitement , and the nature of his order , all confirm the rumour which be already begin to buzz round the court . he know enough of the intrigue and antagonism with which the court be full to understand that every precaution be necessary in carry out his instruction . he wait , therefore , until night have fall before order his to bring round the two horse to one of the less public gate of the ground . as he and his friend walk together to the spot , he give the young a rapid sketch of the situation at the court , and of the chance that this nocturnal ride might be an event which would affect the future history of . " i like your king , " say , " and i be glad to ride in his service . he be a slip of a man to be the head of a great nation , but he have the eye of a chief . if one meet him alone in a forest , one would know him as a man who be different to his fellow . well , i be glad that he be go to marry again , though it be a great house for any woman to have to look after . " smile at his comrade 's idea of a queen 's duty . " be you arm ? " he ask . " you have no sword or pistol ? " " no ; if i may not carry my gun , i have rather not be trouble by tool that i have never learn to use . i have my knife . but why do you ask ? " " because there may be danger . " " and how ? " " many have an interest in stop this marriage . all the first man of the kingdom be bitterly against it . if they could stop , they would stop , for at least . " " but i think it be a secret ? " " there be no such thing at a court . there be the dauphin , or the king 's brother , either of them , or any of their friend , would be right glad that we should be in the before we reach the archbishop 's house this night . but who be this ? " a burly figure have loom up through the gloom on the path upon which they be go . as it approach , a coloured lamp dangle from one of the tree shine upon the blue and silver of an officer of the guard . it be , of 's own regiment . " ! whither away ? " he ask . " to , major . " " i go there myself within an hour . will you not wait , that we may go together ? " " i be sorry , but i ride on a matter of urgency . i must not lose a minute . " " very good . , and a pleasant ride . " " be he a trusty man , our friend the major ? " ask , glance back . " true as steel . " " then i would have a word with him . " the american hurried back along the way they have come , while stand chafe at this unnecessary delay . it be a full five minute before his companion join him , and the fiery blood of the french soldier be hot with impatience and anger . " i think that perhaps you have well ride into at your leisure , my friend , " say he . " if i go upon the king 's service i can be delay whenever the whim take you . " " i be sorry , " answer the other quietly . " i have something to say to your major , and i think that maybe i might not see him again . " " well , here be the horse , " say the guardsman as he push open the . " have you feed an water them , ? " " yes , my captain , " answer the man who stand at their head . " boot and saddle , then , friend green , and we shall not draw rein again until we see the light of in front of us . " the peer through the darkness after them with a sardonic smile upon his face . " you wo n't draw rein , wo n't you ? " he mutter as he turn away . " well , we shall see about that , my captain ; we shall see about that . " for a mile or more the comrade gallop along , neck to neck and knee to knee . a wind have spring up from the westward , and the heaven be cover with heavy gray cloud , which drift swiftly across , a crescent moon peep fitfully from time to time between the rift . even during these moment of brightness the road , shadow as it be by heavy tree , be very dark , but when the light be shut off it be hard , but for the loom upon either side , to tell where it lie . at least find it so , and he peer anxiously over his horse 's ear , and stoop his face to the mane in his effort to see his way . " what do you make of the road ? " he ask at last . " it look as if a good many carriage wheel have pass over it . " " what ! ! do you mean to say that you can see carriage wheel there ? " " certainly . why not ? " " why , man , i can see the road at all . " laugh heartily . " when you have travel in the wood by night as often as i have , " say he , " when to show a light may mean to lose your hair , one come to learn to use one 's eye . " " then you have well ride on , and i shall keep just behind you . so ! ! what be the matter now ? " there have be the sudden sharp snap of something breaking , and the have reel for an instant in the saddle . " it be one of my stirrup leather . it have fall . " " can you find it ? " " yes ; but i can ride as well without it . let us push on . " " very good . i can just see you now . " they have gallop for about five minute in this fashion , 's horse be head within a few foot of the other 's tail , when there be a second snap , and the guardsman roll out of the saddle on to the ground . he keep his grip of the rein , however , and be up in an instant at his horse 's head , sputter out oath as only an angry frenchman can . " a thousand thunder of heaven ! " he cry . " what be it that happen then ? " " your leather have go too . " " two stirrup leather in five minute ? it be not possible . " " it be not possible that it should be chance , " say the american gravely , swing himself off his horse . " why , what be this ? my other leather be cut , and hang only by a thread . " " and so do mine . i can feel it when i pass my hand along . have you a tinder-box ? let us strike a light . " " no , no ; the man who be in the dark be in safety . i let the other folk strike light . we can see all that be needful to us . " " my rein be cut also . " " and so be mine . " " and the girth of my saddle . " " it be a wonder that we come so far with whole bone . now , who have play us this little trick ? " " who could it be but that rogue ! he have have the horse in his charge . by my faith , he shall know what the strappado mean when i see again . " " but why should he do it ? " " ah , he have be set on to it . he have be a tool in the hand of those who wish to hinder our journey . " " very like . but they must have have some reason behind . they know well that to cut our strap would not prevent us from reach , since we could ride bareback , or , for that matter , could run it if need be . " " they hope to break our neck . " " one neck they might break , but scarce those of two , since the fate of the one would warn the other . " " well , then , what do you think that they mean ? " cry impatiently . " for heaven 's sake , let us come to some conclusion , for every minute be of importance . " but the other be not to be hurry out of his cool , methodical fashion of speech and of thought . " they could not have think to stop us , " say he . " what do they mean , then ? they could only have mean to delay us . and why should they wish to delay us ? what could it matter to them if we give our message an hour or two sooner or an hour or two late ? it could not matter . " " for heaven 's -- " broke in impetuously . but go on hammer the matter slowly out . " why should they wish to delay us , then ? there be only one reason that i can see . in order to give other folk time to get in front of us and stop us . that be it , captain . i will lay you a to a that i be on the track . there have be a party of a dozen horseman along this ground since the dew begin to fall . if they be delay , they would have time to form their plan before we come . " " by my faith , you may be right , " say thoughtfully . " what would you propose ? " " that we ride back , and go by some less direct way . " " it be impossible . we should have to ride back to , and then it would add ten mile to our journey . " " it be good to get there an hour later than not to get there at all . " " ! we be surely not to be turn from our path by a mere guess . there be the about a mile below . when we reach it we can strike to the right along the south side of the river , and so change our course . " " but we may not reach it . " " if anyone bar our way we shall know how to treat with them . " " you would fight , then ? " " yes . " " what ! with a dozen of them ? " " a hundred , if we be on the king 's errand . " shrug his shoulder . " you be surely not afraid ? " " yes , i be , mighty afraid . fight be good enough when there be no help for it . but i call it a fool 's plan to ride straight into a trap when you might go round it . " " you may do what you like , " say angrily . " my father be a gentleman , the owner of a thousand arpent of land , and his son be not go to flinch in the king 's service . " " my father , " answer , " be a merchant , the owner of a thousand , and his son know a fool when he see one . " " you be insolent , sir , " cry the guardsman . " we can settle this matter at some more fitting opportunity . at present i continue my mission , and you be very welcome to turn back to if you be so incline . " he raise his hat with punctilious politeness , spring on to his horse , and ride on down the road . hesitate a little , and then mount , he soon overtake his companion . the latter , however , be still in no very sweet temper , and ride with a rigid neck , without a glance or a word for his comrade . suddenly his eye catch something in the gloom which bring a smile back to his face . away in front of them , between two dark tree clump , lie a vast number of shimmer , glitter yellow point , as thick as flower in a garden . they be the light of . " see ! " he cry , point . " there be the city , and close here must be the road . we shall take it , so as to avoid any danger . " " very good ! but you should not ride too fast , when your girth may break at any moment . " " , come on ; we be close to our journey 's end . the road open just round this corner , and then we shall see our way , for the light will guide us . " he cut his horse with his whip , and they gallop together round the curve . next instant they be both down in one wild heap of toss head and struggle hoof , partly cover by his horse , and his comrade hurl twenty pace , where he lie silent and motionless in the centre of the road . monsieur have lay his ambuscade with discretion . with a closed carriage and a band of choose ruffian he have leave the palace a good half-hour before the king 's messenger , and by the aid of his sister 's gold he have manage that their journey should not be a very rapid one . on reach the branch road he have order the coachman to drive some little distance along it , and have tether all the horse to a fence under his charge . he have then station one of the band as a sentinel some distance up the main highway to flash a light when the two courtier be approach . a stout cord have be fasten eighteen inch from the ground to the trunk of a wayside sapling , and on receive the signal the other end be tie to a gate-post upon the further side . the two cavalier could not possibly see it , come as it do at the very curve of the road , and as a consequence their horse fall heavily to the ground , and bring them down with them . in an instant the dozen ruffian who have lurk in the shadow of the tree spring out upon them , sword in hand ; but there be no movement from either of their victim . lie breathe heavily , one leg under his horse 's neck , and the blood trickle in a thin stream down his pale face , and fall , drop by drop , on to his silver shoulder-strap . be , but his injured girth have give way in the fall , and he have be hurl from his horse on to the hard road with a violence which have drive every particle of breath from his body . monsieur light a lantern , and flash it upon the face of the two unconscious man . " this be a bad business , , " say he to the man next him . " i believe that they be both go . " " tut ! tut ! by my soul , man do not die like that when i be young ! " answer the other , lean forward his fierce grizzled face into the light of the lantern . " i have be cast from my horse as often as there be tag to my doublet , but , save for the snap of a bone or two , i never have any harm from it . pass your rapier under the third rib of the horse , ; they will never be fit to set hoof to ground again . " two sob gasp and the thud of their strain neck fall back to earth tell that the two steed have come to the end of their trouble . " where be ? " ask monsieur . " have study medicine at . where be he ? " " here i be , your excellency . it be not for me to boast , but i be as handy a man with a lancet as with a rapier , and it be an evil day for some sick folk when i first take to buff and bandolier . which would you have me look to ? " " this one in the road . " the trooper bent over . " he be not long for this world , " say he . " i can tell it by the catch of his breath . " " and what be his injury ? " " a of the epigastrium . ah , the word of learn will still come to my tongue , but it be hard to put into common term . methinks that it be well for me to pass my dagger through his throat , for his end be very near . " " not for your life ! " cry the leader . " if he die without wound , they can lay it to our charge . turn now to the other . " the man bent over , and place his hand upon his heart . as he do so the soldier heave a long sigh , open his eye , and gaze about him with the face of one who know neither where he be nor how he come there . , who have draw his hat down over his eye , and muffle the low part of his face in his mantle , take out his flask , and pour a little of the content down the injured man 's throat . in an instant a dash of colour have come back into the guardsman 's bloodless cheek , and the light of memory into his eye . he struggle up on to his foot , and strive furiously to push away those who hold him . but his head still swim , and he could scarce hold himself erect . " i must to ! " he gasp ; " i must to ! it be the king 's mission . you stop me at your peril ! " " he have no hurt save a scratch , " say the . " then hold him fast . and first carry the die man to the carriage . " the lantern throw but a small ring of yellow light , so that when it have be carry over to , be leave lie in the shadow . now they bring the light back to where the young man lie . but there be no sign of him . he be go . for a moment the little group of ruffian stand stare , the light of their lantern stream up upon their plume hat , their fierce eye , and savage face . then a burst of oath break from them , and catch the false doctor by the throat , and hurl him down , would have choke him upon the spot , have the other not drag them apart . " you lie dog ! " he cry . " be this your skill ? the man have flee , and we be ruin ! " " he have do it in his , " gasp the other hoarsely , sit up and rub his throat . " i tell you that he be in . he can be far off . " " that be true . he can be far off , " cry . " he have neither horse nor arm . you , and , guard the other , that he play us no trick . do you , , and you , , ride down the road , and wait by the south gate . if he enter at all , he must come in that way . if you get him , tie him before you on your horse , and bring him to the rendezvous . in any case , it matter little , for he be a stranger , this fellow , and only here by chance . now lead the other to the carriage , and we shall get away before an alarm be give . " the two horseman ride off in pursuit of the fugitive , and , still struggle desperately to escape , be drag down the road and thrust into the carriage , which have wait at some distance while these incident be be enact . three of the horseman ride ahead , the coachman be curtly order to follow them , and , have despatch one of the band with a note to his sister , follow after the coach with the remainder of his desperado . the unfortunate guardsman have now entirely recover his sense , and find himself with a strap round his ankle , and another round his wrist , a captive inside a move prison which lumber heavily along the country road . he have be stun by the shock of his fall , and his leg be badly bruise by the weight of his horse ; but the cut on his forehead be a mere trifle , and the bleeding have already cease . his mind , however , pain him more than his body . he sink his head into his pinion hand , and stamp madly with his foot , rock himself to and fro in his despair . what a fool , a treble fool , he have be ! he , an old soldier , who have see something of war , to walk with open eye into such a trap ! the king have choose him of all man , as a trusty messenger , and yet he have fail fail him so ignominiously , without shot fire or sword draw . he be warn , too , warn by a young man who know nothing of court intrigue , and who be guide only by the wit which have give him . dash himself down upon the leather cushion in the agony of his thought . but then come a return of that common-sense which lie so very closely beneath the impetuosity of the celt . the matter be do now , and he must see if it could not be mend . have escape . that be one grand point in his favour . and have hear the king 's message , and realise its importance . it be true that he know nothing of , but surely a man who could pick his way at night through the forest of would not be baulk in find so well-known a house as that of the archbishop of . but then there come a sudden thought which turn 's heart to lead . the city gate be lock at eight o'clock in the evening . it be now nearly nine . it would have be easy for him , whose uniform be a voucher for his message , to gain his way through . but how could , a foreigner and a civilian , hope to pass ? it be impossible , clearly impossible . and yet , somehow , in spite of the impossibility , he still cling to a vague hope that a man so full of energy and resource might find some way out of the difficulty . and then the thought of escape occur to his mind . might he not even now be in time , perhaps , to carry his own message ? who be these man who have seize him ? they have say nothing to give him a hint as to whose tool they be . monsieur and the dauphin occur to his mind . probably one or the other . he have only recognise one of them , old , a man who frequent the low of , and whose sword be ever at the disposal of the long purse . and where be these people take him to ? it might be to his death . but if they wish to do away with him , why should they have bring him back to consciousness ? and why this carriage and drive ? full of curiosity , he peer out of the window . a horseman be ride close up on either side ; but there be glass in front of the carriage , and through this he could gain some idea as to his whereabouts . the cloud have clear now , and the moon be shine brightly , bath the whole wide landscape in its shimmer light . to the right lie the open country , broad plain with clump of woodland , and the tower of castle prick out from above the grove . a heavy bell be ring in some monastery , and its dull booming come and go with the breeze . on the left , but far away , lie the glimmer of . they be leave it rapidly behind . whatever his destination , it be neither the capital nor . then he begin to count the chance of escape . his sword have be remove , and his pistol be still in the holster beside his unfortunate horse . he be unarm , then , even if he could free himself , and his captor be at least a dozen in number . there be three on ahead , ride abreast along the white , moonlit road . then there be one on each side , and he should judge by the clatter of hoof that there could not be few than half a dozen behind . that would make exactly twelve , include the coachman , too many , surely , for an unarmed man to hope to baffle . at the thought of the coachman he have glance through the glass front at the broad back of the man , and he have suddenly , in the glimmer of the carriage lamp , observed something which strike him with horror . the man be evidently desperately wound . it be strange indeed that he could still sit there and flick his whip with so terrible an injury . in the back of his great red coat , just under the left shoulder-blade , be a gash in the cloth , where some weapon have pass , and all round be a wide patch of dark scarlet which tell its own tale . nor be this all . as he raise his whip , the moonlight shine upon his hand , and see with a shudder that it also be splash and clog with blood . the guardsman crane his neck to catch a glimpse of the man 's face ; but his broad-brimmed hat be draw low , and the high collar of his be raise , so that his feature be in the shadow . this silent man in front of him , with the horrible mark upon his person , send a chill to 's valiant heart , and he mutter over one of 's huguenot psalm ; for who but the foul fiend himself would drive a coach with those crimson hand and with a sword drive through his body ? and now they have come to a spot where the main road run onwards , but a small side track wind away down the steep slope of a hill , and so in the direction of the . the have keep to the main road , and the two horseman on either side be trot in the same direction , when , to 's amazement , the carriage suddenly swerve to one side , and in an instant plunge down the steep incline , the two stout horse gallop at their topmost speed , the coachman stand up and lash furiously at them , and the clumsy old vehicle bound along in a way which throw him backwards and forwards from one seat to the other . behind him he could hear a shout of consternation from the escort , and then the rush of gallop hoof . away they fly , the roadside poplar dance past at either window , the horse thunder along with their stomach to the earth , and that demon driver still wave those horrible red hand in the moonlight and scream out to the madden steed . sometimes the carriage jolt one way , sometimes another , sway furiously , and run on two side wheel as though it must every instant go over . and yet , fast as they go , their pursuer go faster still . the rattle of their hoof be at their very back , and suddenly at one of the window there come into view the red , distend nostril of a horse . slowly it draw forward , the muzzle , the eye , the ear , the mane , come into sight as the rider still gain upon them , and then above them the fierce face of and the gleam of a brass pistol barrel . " at the horse , , at the horse ! " cry an authoritative voice from behind . the pistol flash , and the coach lurch over as one of the horse give a convulsive spring . but the driver still shriek and lash with his whip , while the carriage bound onwards . but now the road turn a sudden curve , and there , right in front of them , not a hundred pace away , be the , run cold and still in the moonshine . the bank on either side of the highway run straight down without any break to the water 's edge . there be no sign of a bridge , and a black shadow in the centre of the stream show where the ferry-boat be return after convey some belated traveller across . the driver never hesitate , but gather up the rein , he urge the frightened creature into the river . they hesitate , however , when they first feel the cold water about their hock , and even as they do so one of them , with a low moan , fall over upon her side . 's bullet have find its mark . like a flash the coachman hurl himself from the box and plunge into the stream ; but the pursue horseman be all round him before this , and half-a-dozen hand have seize him ere he could reach deep water , and have drag him to the bank . his broad hat have be strike off in the struggle , and see his face in the moonshine . great heaven ! it be . the desperado be as much astonish as be when they find that they have recapture in this extraordinary manner the messenger whom they have give up for lose . a volley of oath and exclamation break from them , as , on tear off the huge red coat of the coachman , they disclose the sombre dress of the young . " a thousand thunder ! " cry one . " and this be the man whom that devil 's brat would make out to be dead ! " " and how come he here ? " " and where be ? " " he have stab . see the great cut in the coat ! " " ay ; and see the colour of his hand ! he have stab him , and take his coat and hat . " " what ! while we be all within stone 's cast ! " " ay ; there be no other way out of it . " " by my soul ! " cry old , " i have never much love for old , but i have empty a cup of wine with him before now , and i shall see that he have justice . let us cast these rein round the fellow 's neck and hang him upon this tree . " several pair of hand be already unbuckle the harness of the dead horse , when push his way into the little group , and with a few curt word check their intended violence . " it be as much as your life be worth to touch him , " say he . " but he have slay . " " that score may be settle afterwards . he be the king 's messenger . be the other all safe ? " " yes , he be here . " " tie this man , and put him in beside him . unbuckle the trace of the dead horse . so ! now , , put your own into the harness . you can mount the box and drive , for we have not very far to go . " the change be rapidly make ; be thrust in beside , and the carriage be soon toil up the steep incline which it have come down so precipitately . the have say not a word since his capture , and have remain absolutely stolid , with his hand cross over his chest whilst his fate be under discussion . now that he be alone once more with his comrade , however , he frown and mutter like a man who feel that fortune have use him badly . " those infernal horse ! " he grumble . " why , an american horse would have take to the water like a duck . many a time have i swim my old stallion across the . once over the river , we should have have a clear lead to . " " my dear friend , " cry , lay his manacle hand upon those of his comrade , " can you forgive me for speak as i do upon the way from ? " " tut , man ! i never give it a think . " " you be right a thousand time , and i be , as you say , a blind , obstinate fool . how nobly you have stand by me ! but how come you there ? never in my life have i be so astonish as when i see your face . " chuckle to himself . " i think that maybe it would be a surprise to you if you know who be drive you , " say he . " when i be throw from my horse i lie quiet , partly because i want to get a grip of my breath , and partly because it seem to me to be more healthy to lie than to stand with all those sword clink in my ear . then they all get round you , and i roll into the ditch , creep along it , get on the in the shadow of the tree , and be beside the carriage before ever they know that i be go . i see in a flash that there be only one way by which i could be of use to you . the coachman be lean round with his head turn to see what be go on behind him . i out with my knife , spring up on the front wheel , and stop his tongue forever . " " what ! without a sound ! " " i have not live among the for nothing . " " and then ? " " i pull him down into the ditch , and i get into his coat and his hat . i do not scalp him . " " scalp him ? great heaven ! such thing be only do among savage . " " ah ! i think that maybe it be not the custom of the country . i be glad now that i do not do it . i have hardly get the rein before they be all back and bundle you into the coach . i be not afraid of their see me , but i be scare lest i should not know which road to take , and so set them on the trail . but they make it easy to me by send some of their rider in front , so i do well until i see that and make a run for it . we will have get away , too , if that rogue have n't shoot the horse , and if the beast have face the water . " the guardsman again press his comrade 's hand . " you have be as true to me as hilt to blade , " say he . " it be a bold thought and a bold deed . " " and what now ? " ask the . " i do not know who these man be , and i do not know whither they be take us . " " to their village , likely , to burn us . " laugh in spite of his anxiety . " you will have it that we be back in again , " say he . " they do n't do thing in that way in . " " they seem free enough with hang in . i tell you , i feel like a ' coon when that trace be round my neck . " " i fancy that they be take us to some place where they can shut us up until this business blow over . " " well , they will need to be smart about it . " " why ? " " else maybe they wo n't find us when they want us . " " what do you mean ? " for answer , the , with a twist and a wriggle , draw his two hand apart , and hold them in front of his comrade 's face . " bless you , it be the first thing they teach the papoose in an indian wigwam . i have get out of a 's thong of raw hide before now , and it ai n't very likely that a stiff stirrup leather will hold me . put your hand out . " with a few dexterous twist he loosen 's bond , until he also be able to slip his hand free . " now for your foot , if you will put them up . they will find that we be easy to catch than to hold . " but at that moment the carriage begin to slow down , and the clank of the hoof of the rider in front of them die suddenly away . peep through the window , the prisoner see a huge dark building stretch in front of them , so high and so broad that the night shroud it in upon every side . a great archway hang above them , and the lamp shine on the rude wooden gate , stud with ponderous clamp and nail . in the upper part of the door be a small square iron grating , and through this they could catch a glimpse of the gleam of a lantern and of a bearded face which look out at them . , standing in his stirrup , crane his neck up towards the grating , so that the two man most interested could hear little of the conversation which follow . they see only that the horseman hold a gold ring up in the air , and that the face above , which have begin by shake and frown , be now nod and smile . an instant later the head disappear , the door swing open upon scream hinge , and the carriage drive on into the courtyard beyond , leave the escort , with the exception of , outside . as the horse pull up , a knot of rough fellow cluster round , and the two prisoner be drag roughly out . in the light of the torch which flare around them they could see that they be hem in by high turreted wall upon every side . a bulky man with a bearded face , the same whom they have see at the grating , be stand in the centre of the group of armed man issue his order . " to the upper dungeon , ! " he cry . " and see that they have two bundle of straw and a loaf of bread until we learn our master 's will . " " i know not who your master may be , " say , " but i would ask you by what warrant he dare to stop two messenger of the king while travel in his service ? " " by , if my master play the king a trick , it will be but tie and tie , " the stout man answer , with a grin . " but no more talk ! away with them , , and you answer to me for their safe-keeping . " it be in vain that rave and threaten , invoke the most terrible menace upon all who be concern in detain him . two stout knave thrust him from behind and one drag in front force him through a narrow gate and along a passage , a small man in black buckram with a bunch of key in one hand and a swing lantern in the other lead the way . their ankle have be so tie that they could but take step of a foot in length . shuffle along , they make their way down three successive corridor and through three door , each of which be lock and bar behind them . then they ascend a wind stone stair , hollow out in the centre by the foot of generation of prisoner and of jailer , and finally they be thrust into a small square dungeon , and two truss of straw be throw in after them . an instant later a heavy key turn in the lock , and they be leave to their own meditation . very grim and dark those meditation be in the case of . a stroke of good luck have make him at court , and now this other of ill fortune have destroy him . it would be in vain that he should plead his own powerlessness . he know his royal master well . he be a man who be munificent when his order be obey , and inexorable when they miscarry . no excuse avail with him . an unlucky man be as abhorrent to him as a negligent one . in this great crisis the king have trust him with an all-important message , and that message have not be deliver . what could save him now from disgrace and from ruin ? he care nothing for the dim dungeon in which he find himself , nor for the uncertain fate which hang over his head , but his heart turn to lead when he think of his blasted career , and of the triumph of those whose jealousy have be arouse by his rapid promotion . there be his people in , sweet , his old uncle , who have be as good as a father to him . what protector would they have in their trouble now that he have lose the power that might have shield them ? how long would it be before they be expose once more to the brutality of and his dragoon ? he clench his tooth at the thought , and throw himself down with a groan upon the litter of straw dimly visible in the faint light which stream through the single window . but his energetic comrade have yield to no feeling of despondency . the instant that the clang of the prison door have assure him that he be safe from interruption he have slip off the bond which hold him and have feel all round the wall and floor to see what manner of place this might be . his search have end in the discovery of a small fireplace at one corner , and of two great clumsy billet of wood , which seem to have be leave there to serve as pillow for the prisoner . have satisfy himself that the chimney be so small that it be utterly impossible to pass even his head up it , he draw the two block of wood over to the window , and be able , by place one above the other and stand on tiptoe on the high , to reach the bar which guard it . draw himself up , and fix one toe in an inequality of the wall , he manage to look out on to the courtyard which they have just quit . the carriage and be pass out through the gate as he look , and he hear a moment later the slam of the heavy door and the clatter of hoof from the troop of horseman outside . the seneschal and his retainer have disappear ; the torch , too , be go , and , save for the measure tread of a pair of sentinel in the yard twenty foot beneath him , all be silent throughout the great castle . and a very great castle it be . even as he hang there with straining hand his eye be run in admiration and amazement over the huge wall in front of him , with its fringe of turret and pinnacle and battlement all lie so still and cold in the moonlight . strange thought will slip into a man 's head at the most unlikely moment . he remember suddenly a bright summer day over the water when first he have come down from , and how his father have meet him on the wharf by the , and have take him through the to see 's house , as a sign of how great this city be which have pass from the dutch to the . why , 's house and 's villa put together would not make one wing of this huge pile , which be itself a mere beside the mighty palace at . he would that his father be here now ; and then , on second thought , he would not , for it come back to him that he be a prisoner in a far land , and that his sight-seeing be be do through the bar of a dungeon window . the window be large enough to pass his body through if it be not for those bar . he shake them and hang his weight upon them , but they be as thick as his thumb and firmly weld . then , get some strong hold for his other foot , he support himself by one hand while he pick with his knife at the setting of the iron . it be cement , as smooth as glass and as hard as marble . his knife turn when he try to loosen it . but there be still the stone . it be sandstone , not so very hard . if he could cut groove in it , he might be able to draw out bar , cement , and all . he spring down to the floor again , and be think how he should well set to work , when a groan draw his attention to his companion . " you seem sick , friend , " say he . " sick in mind , " moan the other . " oh , the cursed fool that i have be ! it madden me ! " " something on your mind ? " say , sit down upon his billet of wood . " what be it , then ? " the guardsman make a movement of impatience . " what be it ? how can you ask me , when you know as well as i do the wretched failure of my mission . it be the king 's wish that the archbishop should marry them . the king 's wish be the law . it must be the archbishop or none . he should have be at the palace by now . ah , my ! i can see the king 's cabinet , i can see him wait , i can see madame waiting , i can hear them speak of the unhappy -- " he bury his face in his hand once more . " i see all that , " say the american stolidly , " and i see something more . " " what then ? " " i see the archbishop tie them up together . " " the archbishop ! you be rave . " " maybe . but i see him . " " he could not be at the palace . " " on the contrary , he reach the palace about half an hour ago . " spring to his foot . " at the palace ! " he scream . " then who give him the message ? " " i do , " say . if the have expect to surprise or delight his companion by this curt announcement he be woefully disappoint , for approach him with a face which be full of sympathy and trouble , and lay his hand caressingly upon his shoulder . " my dear friend , " say he , " i have be selfish and thoughtless . i have make too much of my own little trouble and too little of what you have go through for me . that fall from your horse have shake you more than you think . lie down upon this straw , and see if a little sleep may -- " " i tell you that the bishop be there ! " cry impatiently . " quite so . there be water in this jug , and if i dip my scarf into it and tie it round your -- " " man alive ! do n't you hear me ! the bishop be there . " " he be , he be , " say soothingly . " he be most certainly there . i trust that you have no pain ? " the wave in the air with his knotted fist . " you think that i be craze , " he cry , " and , by the eternal , you be enough to make me so ! when i say that i send the bishop , i mean that i see to the job . you remember when i step back to your friend the major ? " it be the soldier 's turn to grow excite now . " well ? " he cry , grip the other 's arm . " well , when we send a scout into the wood , if the matter be worth it , we send a second one at another hour , and so one or other come back with his hair on . that be the iroquois fashion , and a good fashion too . " " ! i believe that you have save me ! " " you need n't grip on to my arm like a on a trout ! i go back to the major , then , and i ask him when he be in to pass by the archbishop 's door . " " well ? well ? " " i show him this lump of chalk . ' if we have be there , ' say i , ' you will see a great cross on the leave side of the door-post . if there be no cross , then pull the latch and ask the bishop if he will come up to the palace as quick as his horse can bring him . ' the major start an hour after us ; he would be in by ten ; the bishop would be in his carriage by eleven , and he would reach half an hour ago , that be to say , about twelve . by the , i think i have drive him off his head ! " it be no wonder that the young woodsman be alarm at the effect of his own announcement . his slow and steady nature be incapable of the quick , violent variation of the fiery frenchman . , who have throw off his bond before he have lie down , spin round the cell now , wave his arm and his leg , with his shadow caper up the wall behind him , all distort in the moonlight . finally he throw himself into his comrade 's arm with a torrent of thank and ejaculation and praise and promise , pat him with his hand and hug him to his breast . " oh , if i could but do something for you ! " he exclaim . " if i could do something for you ! " " you can , then . lie down on that straw and go to sleep . " " and to think that i sneer at you ! i ! oh , you have have your revenge ! " " for the 's sake , lie down and go to sleep ! " by persuasion and a little push he get his delighted companion on to his couch again , and heap the straw over him to serve as a blanket . be weary out by the excitement of the day , and this last great reaction seem to have absorb all his remain strength . his lid droop heavily over his eye , his head sink deep into the soft straw , and his last remembrance be that the tireless be seat cross-legged in the moonlight , work furiously with his long knife upon one of the billet of wood . so weary be the young guardsman that it be long past noon , and the sun be shine out of a cloudless blue sky , before he awake . for a moment , envelop as he be in straw , and with the rude arch of the dungeon meeting in four rough-hew above his head , he stare about him in bewilderment . then in an instant the doings of the day before , his mission , the ambuscade , his imprisonment , all flash back to him , and he spring to his foot . his comrade , who have be doze in the corner , jump up also at the first movement , with his hand on his knife , and a sinister glance direct towards the door . " oh , it be you , be it ? " say he , " i think it be the man . " " have some one be in , then ? " " yes ; they bring those two loaf and a jug of water , just about dawn , when i be settle down for a rest . " " and do he say anything ? " " no ; it be the little black one . " " , they call him . " " the same . he lay the thing down and be go . i think that maybe if he come again we might get him to stop . " " how , then ? " " maybe if we get these stirrup leather round his ankle he would not get them off quite as easy as we have do . " " and what then ? " " well , he would tell us where we be , and what be to be do with us . " " ! what do it matter since our mission be do ? " " it may not matter to be no accounting for it matter a good deal to me . i be not use to sit in a hole , like a bear in a trap , wait for what other folk choose to do with me . it be new to me . i find a pretty close sort of place , but it be a prairie compare to this . it do n't suit a man of my habit , and i be go to come out of it . " " there be no help but patience , my friend . " " i do n't know that . i will get more help out of a bar and a few peg . " he open his coat , and take out a short piece of rust iron , and three small thick piece of wood , sharpen at one end . " where do you get those , then ? " " these be my night 's work . the bar be the top one of the grate . i have a job to loosen it , but there it be . the peg i whittle out of that log . " " and what be they for ? " " well , you see , peg number one go in here , where i have pick a hole between the stone . then i have make this other log into a mallet , and with two crack there it be firm fix , so that you can put your weight on it . now these two go in the same way into the hole above here . so ! now , you see , you can stand up there and look out of that window without ask too much of your toe joint . try it . " spring up and look eagerly out between the bar . " i do not know the place , " say he , shake his head . " it may be any one of thirty castle which lie upon the south side of , and within six or seven league of it . which can it be ? and who have any interest in treat us so ? i would that i could see a coat of arm , which might help us . ah ! there be one yonder in the centre of the mullion of the window . but i can scarce read it at the distance . i warrant that your eye be good than mine , , and that you can read what be on yonder escutcheon . " " on what ? " " on the stone slab in the centre window . " " yes , i see it plain enough . it look to me like three sit on a barrel of molasses . " " three in chief over a tower proper , maybe . those be the arm of the . but it can be that . they have no chateau within a hundred league . no , i can tell where we be . " he be drop back to the floor , and put his weight upon the bar . to his amazement , it come away in his hand . " look , , look ! " he cry . " ah , you have find it out ! well , i do that during the night . " " and how ? with your knife ? " " no ; i could make no way with my knife ; but when i get the bar out of the grate , i manage faster . i will put this one back now , or some of those folk down below may notice that we have get it loose . " " be they all loose ? " " only the one at present , but we will get the other two out during the night . you can take that bar out and work with it , while i use my own picker at the other . you see , the stone be soft , and by grind it you soon make a groove along which you can slip the bar . it will be mighty queer if we ca n't clear a road for ourselves before morning . " " well , but even if we could get out into the courtyard , where could we turn to then ? " " one thing at a time , friend . you might as well stick at the because you could not see how you would cross the penobscot . anyway , there be more air in the yard than in here , and when the window be clear we shall soon plan out the rest . " the two comrade do not dare to do any work during the day , for fear they should be surprise by the jailer , or observe from without . no one come near them , but they eat their loaf and drink their water with the appetite of man who have often know what it be to be without even such simple food as that . the instant that night fall they be both up upon the peg , grind away at the hard stone and tug at the bar . it be a rainy night , and there be a sharp , but they could see very well , while the shadow of the arched window prevent their be see . before midnight they have loosen one bar , and the other be just begin to give , when some slight noise make them turn their head , and there be their jailer standing , open-mouthed in the middle of the cell , stare up at them . it be who observe him first , and he spring down at him in an instant with his bar ; but at his movement the man rush for the door , and draw it after him just as the 's tool whiz past his ear and down the passage . as the door slam , the two comrade look at each other . the guardsman shrug his shoulder and the other whistle . " it be scarce worth while to go on , " say . " we may as well be do that as anything else . if my picker have be an inch lower i will have have him . well , maybe he will get a stroke , or break his neck down those stair . i have nothing to work with now , but a few rub with your bar will finish the job . ah , dear ! you be right , and we be fairly tree ! " a great bell have begin to ring in the chateau , and there be a loud buzz of voice and a clatter of foot upon the stone . hoarse order be shout , and there be the sound of turn key . all this come suddenly in the midst of the stillness of the night show only too certainly that the alarm have be give . throw himself down in the straw , with his hand in his pocket , and lean sulkily against the wall , wait for whatever might come to him . five minute pass , however , and yet another five minute , without anyone appear . the hubbub in the courtyard continue , but there be no sound in the corridor which lead to their cell . " well , i will have that bar out , after all , " say the american at last , rise and step over to the window . " anyhow , we will see what all this caterwaul be about . " he climb up on his peg as he speak , and peep out . " come up ! " he cry excitedly to his comrade . " they have get some other game go on here , and they be all a deal too busy to bother their head about us . " clamber up beside him , and the two stand stare down into the courtyard . a brazier have be light at each corner , and the place be throng with man , many of whom carry torch . the yellow glare play fitfully over the grim gray wall , flicker up sometimes until the high turret shine golden against the black sky , and then , as the wind catch them , die away until they scarce throw a glow upon the cheek of their bearer . the main gate be open , and a carriage , which have apparently just drive in , be stand at a small door immediately in front of their window . the wheel and side be brown with mud , and the two horse be reek and , as though their journey have be both swift and long . a man wear a plume hat and envelop in a have step from the carriage , and then , turn round , have drag a second person out after him . there be a scuffle , a cry , a push , and the two figure have vanish through the door . as it close , the carriage drive away , the torch and brazier be extinguish , the main gate be close once more , and all be as quiet as before this sudden interruption . " well ! " gasp . " be this another king 's messenger they have get ? " " there will be lodging for two more here in a short time , " say . " if they only leave us alone , this cell wo n't hold us long . " " i wonder where that jailer have go ? " " he may go where he like , as long as he keep away from here . give me your bar again . this thing be give . it wo n't take us long to have it out . " he set to work furiously , try to deepen the groove in the stone , through which he hope to drag the staple . suddenly he cease , and strain his ear . " by thunder ! " say he , " there be some one working on the other side . " they both stand listen . there be the thud of hammer , the rasping of a saw , and the clatter of wood from the other side of the wall . " what can they be do ? " " i ca n't think . " " can you see them ? " " they be too near the wall . " " i think i can manage , " say . " i be slight than you . " he push his head and neck and half of one shoulder through the gap between the bar , and there he remain until his friend think that perhaps he have stick , and pull at his leg to extricate him . he writhe back , however , without any difficulty . " they be build something , " he whisper . " building ! " " yes ; there be four of them , with a lantern . " " what can they be build , then ? " " it be a shed , i think . i can see four socket in the ground , and they be fix four upright into them . " " well , we ca n't get away as long as there be four man just under our window . " " impossible . " " but we may as well finish our work , for all that . " the gentle of his iron be drown amid the noise which swell ever loud from without . the bar loosen at the end , and he draw it slowly towards him . at that instant , however , just as he be disengage it , a round head appear between him and the moonlight , a head with a great shock of tangled hair and a woollen cap upon the top of it . so astonish be at the sudden apparition that he let go his grip upon the bar , which , fall outward , topple over the edge of the window-sill . " you great fool ! " shriek a voice from below , " be your finger ever to be thumb , then , that you should fumble your tool so ? a thousand thunder of heaven ! you have break my shoulder . " " what be it , then ? " cry the other . " my faith , , if your finger go as fast as your tongue , you would be the first joiner in . " " what be it , you ape ! you have drop your tool upon me . " " i ! i have drop nothing . " " idiot ! would you have me believe that iron fall from the sky ? i say that you have strike me , you foolish , lout . " " i have not strike you yet , " cry the other , " but , by the , if i have more of this i will come down the ladder to you ! " " silence , you good-for-naught ! " say a third voice sternly . " if the work be not do by daybreak , there will be a heavy reckoning for somebody . " and again the steady hammering and saw go forward . the head still pass and repass , its owner walk apparently upon some platform which they have construct beneath their window , but never give a glance or a thought to the black square opening beside him . it be early morning , and the first cold light be begin to steal over the courtyard , before the work be at last finish and the workman have leave . then at last the prisoner dare to climb up and to see what it be which have be construct during the night . it give them a catch of the breath as they look at it . it be a scaffold . there it lie , the ill-omened platform of dark greasy board newly fasten together , but evidently use often before for the same purpose . it be buttress up against their wall , and extend a clear twenty foot out , with a broad wooden stair lead down from the further side . in the centre stand a headsman 's block , all haggle at the top , and smear with stain . " i think it be time that we leave , " say . " our work be all in vain , , " say sadly . " whatever our fate may this look ill can but submit to it like brave man . " " tut , man ; the window be clear ! let us make a rush for it . " " it be useless . i can see a line of armed man along the further side of the yard . " " a line ! at this hour ! " " yes ; and here come more . see , at the centre gate ! now what in the name of heaven be this ? " as he speak the door which face them open and a singular procession file out . come two dozen footman , walk in pair , all carry halberd , and clad in the same livery . after them a huge bearded man , with his tunic off , and the sleeve of his coarse shirt roll up over his elbow , stride along with a great axe over his left shoulder . behind him , a priest with an open missal patter forth prayer , and in his shadow be a woman , clad in black , her neck bare , and a black shawl cast over her head and droop in front of her bow face . within grip of her walk a tall , thin , man , with harsh red feature , and a great jut nose . he wear a flat velvet cap with a single eagle feather fasten into it by a diamond clasp , which gleam in the morning light . but bright as be his gem , his dark eye be bright still , and sparkle from under his bushy brow with a mad brilliancy which bear with it something of menace and of terror . his limb jerk as he walk , his feature twist , and he carry himself like a man who strive hard to hold himself in when his whole soul be aflame with exultation . behind him again twelve more retainer bring up the rear of this singular procession . the woman have falter at the foot of the scaffold , but the man behind her have thrust her forward with such force that she stumble over the low step , and would have fall have she not clutch at the arm of the priest . at the top of the ladder her eye meet the dreadful block , and she burst into a scream , and shrink backwards . but again the man thrust her on , and two of the follower catch her by either wrist and drag her forward . " oh , ! ! " she scream . " i be not fit to die ! oh , forgive me , , as you hope for forgiveness yourself ! ! ! " she strive to get towards him , to clutch at his wrist , at his sleeve , but he stand with his hand on his sword , gaze at her with a face which be all wreathe and contort with merriment . at the sight of that dreadful mock face the prayer freeze upon her lip . as well pray for mercy to the drop stone or to the rush stream . she turn away , and throw back the mantle which have shroud her feature . " ah , sire ! " she cry . " sire ! if you could see me now ! " and at the cry and at the sight of that fair pale face , , look down from the window , be strike as though by a dagger ; for there , stand beside the headsman 's block , be she who have be the most powerful , as well as the witty and the fair , of the woman of other than , so lately the favourite of the king . on the night upon which such strange chance have befall his messenger , the king sit alone in his cabinet . over his head a perfume lamp , hold up by four little fly of crystal , who dangle by golden chain from the painted ceiling , cast a brilliant light upon the chamber , which be flash back by the mirror upon the wall . the ebony and silver furniture , the dainty carpet of , the silk of , the tapestry of the , the and the delicate chinaware of good of all that could produce be centre between these four wall . nothing have ever pass through that door which be not a masterpiece of its kind . and amid all this brilliance the master of it sit , his chin rest upon his hand , his elbow upon the table , with eye which stare vacantly at the wall , a moody and a solemn man . but though his dark eye be fix upon the wall , they see nothing of it . they look rather down the long vista of his own life , away to those early year when what we dream and what we do shade so mistily into one another . be it a dream or be it a fact , those two man who use to stoop over his baby crib , the one with the dark coat and the star upon his breast , whom he have be teach to call father , and the other one with the long red gown and the little twinkling eye ? even now , after more than forty year , that wicked , astute , powerful face flash up , and he see once more old , the great king of . and then the other cardinal , the long lean one who have take his pocket-money , and have grudge him his food , and have dress him in old clothes . how well he could recall the day when have rouge himself for the last time , and how the court have dance with joy at the news that he be no more ! and his mother , too , how beautiful she be , and how masterful ! could he not remember how bravely she have bear herself during that war in which the power of the great noble have be break , and how she have at last lie down to die , implore the priest not to stain her with their holy oil ! and then he think of what he have do himself , how he have shear down his great subject until , instead of be like a tree among sapling , he have be alone , far above all other , with his shadow cover the whole land . then there be his war and his law and his treaty . under his care have overflow her frontier both on the north and on the east , and yet have be so weld together internally that she have but one voice , with which she speak through him . and then there be that line of beautiful face which waver up in front of him . there be , whose italian eye have first teach him that there be a power which can rule over a king ; her sister , too , ; his wife , with her dark little face ; of , whose death have first show him the horror which lie in life ; , , . some be dead ; some be in convent . some who have be wicked and beautiful be now only wicked . and what have be the outcome of all this troubled , strive life of his ? he be already at the outer verge of his middle year ; he have lose his taste for the pleasure of his youth ; gout and vertigo be ever at his foot and at his head to remind him that between them lie a kingdom which he could not hope to govern . and after all these year he have not win a single true friend , not one , in his family , in his court , in his country , save only this woman whom he be to wed that night . and she , how patient she be , how good , how lofty ! with her he might hope to wipe off by the true glory of his remain year all the sin and the folly of the past . would that the archbishop might come , that he might feel that she be indeed his , that he hold her with hook of steel which would bind them as long as life should last ! there come a tap at the door . he spring up eagerly , think that the ecclesiastic might have arrive . it be , however , only his personal attendant , to say that would crave an interview . close at his heel come the minister himself , and . two leather bag be dangle from his hand . " sire , " say he , when have retire , " i trust that i do not intrude upon you . " " no , no , . my thought be in truth begin to be very indifferent company , and i be glad to be rid of them . " " your 's thought can never , i be sure , be anything but pleasant , " say the courtier . " but i have bring you here something which i trust may make them even more so . " " ah ! what be that ? " " when so many of our young noble go into and , you be please in your wisdom to say that you would like well to see what report they send home to their friend ; also what news be send out from the court to them . " " yes . " " i have them that the courier have bring in , and all that be gather to go out , each in its own bag . the wax have be soften in spirit , the fastening have be steam , and they be now open . " the king take out a handful of the letter and glance at the address . " i should indeed like to read the heart of these people , " say he . " thus only can i tell the true thought of those who bow and simper before my face . i suppose , " with a sudden flash of suspicion from his eye , " that you have not yourself look into these ? " " oh , sire , i have rather die ! " " you swear it ? " " as i hope for salvation ! " " hum ! there be one among these which i see be from your own son . " change colour , and stammer as he look at the envelope . " your majesty will find that he be as loyal out of your presence as in it , else he be no son of mine , " say he . " then we shall begin with his . ! it be but ten line long . ' , how i long for you to come back ! the court be as dull as a cloister now that you be go . my ridiculous father still strut about like a , as if all his medal and crosse could cover the fact that he be but a head lackey , with no more real power than i have . he wheedle a good deal out of the king , but what he do with it i can imagine , for little come my way . i still owe those ten thousand livre to the man in the . unless i have some luck at lansquenet , i shall have to come out soon and join you . ' ! i do you an injustice , . i see that you have not look over these letter . " the minister have sit with a face which be the colour of beetroot , and eye which project from his head , while this epistle be be read . it be with relief that he come to the end of it , for at least there be nothing which compromise him seriously with the king ; but every nerve in his great body tingle with rage as he think of the way in which his young have allude to him . " the viper ! " he cry . " oh , the foul snake in the grass ! i will make him curse the day that he be bear . " " tut , tut , ! " say the king . " you be a man who have see much of life , and you should be a philosopher . hot-headed youth say ever more than it mean . think no more of the matter . but what have we here ? a letter from my dear girl to her husband , the . i would pick her writing out of a thousand . ah , dear soul , she little think that my eye would see her artless prattle ! why should i read it , since i already know every thought of her innocent heart ? " he unfold the sheet of pink scent paper with a fond smile upon his face , but it fade away as his eye glance down the page , and he spring to his foot with a snarl of anger , his hand over his heart and his eye still glue to the paper . " minx ! " he cry , in a choke voice . " impertinent , heartless minx ! , you know what i have do for the princess . you know she have be the apple of my eye . what have i ever grudge her ? what have i ever deny her ? " " you have be goodness itself , sire , " say , whose own wound smart less now that he see his master writhe . " hear what she say of me : ' be much as usual , save that he give a little at the knee . you remember how we use to laugh at his air and grace ! well , he have give up all that , and though he still strut about on great high heel , like a peasant on his stilt , he have no brightness at all in his clothes . of course , all the court follow his example , so you can imagine what a nightmare place this be . then this woman still keep in favour , and her frock be as dismal as 's coat ; so when you come back we shall go into the country together , and you shall dress in red velvet , and i shall wear blue silk , and we shall have a little coloured court of our own in spite of my majestic papa . ' " sink his face in his hand . " you hear how she speak of me , . " " it be infamous , sire ; infamous ! " " she call me , ! " " atrocious , sire . " " and my knee ! one would think that i be an old man ! " " scandalous . but , sire , i would beg to say that it be a case in which your 's philosophy may well soften your anger . youth be ever hot-headed , and say more than it mean . think no more of the matter . " " you speak like a fool , . the child that i have love turn upon me , and you ask me to think no more of it . ah , it be one more lesson that a king can trust least of all those who have his own blood in their vein . what writing be this ? it be the good . one may not have faith in one 's own kin , but this sainted man love me , not only because i have place him where he be , but because it be his nature to look up to and love those whom have place above him . i will read you his letter , , to show you that there be still such a thing as loyalty and gratitude in . ' my dear de la . ' ah , it be to him he write . ' i promise when you leave that i would let you know from time to time how thing be go at court , as you consult me about bring your daughter up from , in the hope that she might catch the king 's fancy . ' what ! what ! ! what villainy be this ? ' the sultan go from bad to bad . the be at least the pretty woman in , though between ourselves there be just a shade too much of the red in her excellent colour in a cardinal 's gown , my dear duke , but nothing bright than chestnut be permissible in a lady . the , too , be a fine woman in her day , but fancy his picking up now with a widow who be old than himself , a woman , too , who do not even try to make herself attractive , but kneel at her prie-dieu or work at her tapestry from morning to night . they say that and make a bad match , but my own opinion be that two november make an even bad one . ' ! ! i can read no more ! have you a de cachet ? " " there be one here , sire . " " for the ? " " no ; for . " " that will do very well . fill it up , ! put this villain 's name in it ! let him be arrest , and take there in his own caleche . the shameless , ungrateful , foul-mouthed villain ! why do you bring me these letter , ? oh , why do you yield to my foolish whim ? , be there no truth , or honour , or loyalty in the world ? " he stamp his foot , and shake his clench hand in the air in the frenzy of his anger and disappointment . " shall i , then , put back the other ? " ask eagerly . he have be on thorn since the king have begin to read them , not know what disclosure might come next . " put them back , but keep the bag . " " both bag ? " " ah ! i have forget the other one . perhaps if i have hypocrite around me , i have at least some honest subject at a distance . let us take one haphazard . who be this from ? ah ! it be from the . he have ever seem to be a modest and dutiful young man . what have he to say ? the grand ! " he give a cry as if he have be stab . " what , then , sire ? " the minister have take a step forward , for he be frighten by the expression upon the king 's face . " take them away , ! take them away ! " he cry , push the pile of paper away from him . " i would that i have never see them ! i will look at them no more ! he gibe even at my courage , i who be in the trench when he be in his cradle ! ' this war would not suit the king , ' he say . ' for there be battle , and none of the nice little safe siege which be so dear to him . ' by , he shall pay to me with his head for that jest ! ay , , it will be a dear gibe to him . but take them away . i have see as much as i can bear . " the minister be thrust them back into the bag when suddenly his eye catch the bold , clear writing of madame upon one of the letter . some demon whisper to him that here be a weapon which have be place in his hand , with which he might strike one whose very name fill him with jealousy and hatred . have she be guilty of some indiscretion in this note , then he might even now , at this last hour , turn the king 's heart against her . he be an astute man , and in an instant he have see his chance and grasp it . " ! " say he , " it be hardly necessary to open this one . " " which , ? whose be it ? " the minister push forward the letter , and start as his eye fall upon it . " madame be write ! " he gasp . " yes ; it be to her nephew in . " take it in his hand . then , with a sudden motion , he throw it down among the other , and then yet again his hand steal towards it . his face be gray and haggard , and bead of moisture have break out upon his brow . if this too be to prove to be as the other ! he be shake to the soul at the very think . twice he try to pluck it out , and twice his tremble finger fumble with the paper . then he toss it over to . " read it to me , " say he . the minister open the letter out and flatten it upon the table , with a malicious light dancing in his eye , which might have cost him his position have the king but read it aright . " ' my dear nephew , ' " he read , " ' what you ask me in your last be absolutely impossible . i have never abuse the king 's favour so far as to ask for any profit for myself , and i should be equally sorry to solicit any advance for my relative . no one would rejoice more than i to see you rise to be major in your regiment , but your valour and your loyalty must be the cause , and you must not hope to do it through any word of mine . to serve such a man as the king be its own reward , and i be sure that whether you remain a cornet or rise to some high rank , you will be equally zealous in his cause . he be surround , unhappily , by many base parasite . some of these be mere fool , like ; other be knave , like the late ; and some seem to be both fool and knave , like , the minister of war . ' " here the reader choke with rage , and sit gurgle and drum his finger upon the table . " go on , , go on , " say , smile up at the ceiling . " ' these be the cloud which surround the sun , my dear nephew ; but the sun be , believe me , shine brightly behind them . for year i have know that noble nature as few other can know it , and i can tell you that his virtue be his own , but that if ever his glory be for an instant dim over , it be because his kindness of heart have allow him to be sway by those who be about him . we hope soon to see you back at , staggering under the weight of your laurel . meanwhile accept my love and every wish for your speedy promotion , although it can be obtain in the way which you suggest . ' " " ah , " cry the king , his love shine in his eye , " how could i for an instant doubt her ! and yet i have be so shake by the other ! be as true as steel . be it not a beautiful letter , ? " " madame be a very clever woman , " say the minister evasively . " and such a reader of heart ! have she not see my character aright ? " " at least she have not read mine , sire . " there be a tap at the door , and peep in . " the archbishop have arrive , sire . " " very well , . ask madame to be so good as to step this way . and order the witness to assemble in the . " as the valet hasten away , turn to his minister : " i wish you to be one of the witness , . " " to what , sire ? " " to my marriage . " the minister start . " what , sire ! already ? " " now , ; within five minute . " " very good , sire . " the unhappy courtier strive hard to assume a more festive manner ; but the night have be full of vexation to him , and to be condemn to assist in make this woman the king 's wife be the most bitter drop of all . " put these letter away , . the last one have make up for all the rest . but these rascal shall smart for it , all the same . , there be that young nephew to whom madame write . be his name , be it not ? " " yes , sire . " " make him out a colonel 's commission , and give him the next vacancy , . " " a colonel , sire ! why , he be not yet twenty . " " ay , . , be i the chief of the army , or be you ? take care , ! i have warn you once before . i tell you , man , that if i choose to promote one of my jack-boot to be the head of a brigade , you shall not hesitate to make out the paper . now go into the , and wait with the other witness until you be want . " there have meanwhile be busy goings-on in the small room where the red lamp burn in front of the . stand in the centre , a little flush of excitement on her cheek , and an unwonted light in her placid gray eye . she be clad in a dress of shine white brocade , trim and slash with silver serge , and fringe at the throat and arm with costly point lace . three woman , group around her , rise and stoop and sway , put a touch here and a touch there , gather in , loop up , and alter until all be to their taste . " there ! " say the head dressmaker , give a final pat to a rosette of gray silk ; " i think that will do , your be to say , madame . " the lady smile at the adroit slip of the courtier dressmaker . " my taste lean little towards dress , " say she , " yet i would fain look as he would wish me to look . " " ah , it be easy to dress madame . madame have a figure . madame have a carriage . what costume would not look well with such a neck and waist and arm to set it off ? but , , madame , what be we to do when we have to make the figure as well as the dress ? there be the . it be but yesterday that we cut her gown . she be short , madame , but thick . oh , it be incredible how thick she be ! she use more cloth than madame , though she be two short . ah , i be sure that the good never mean people to be as thick as that . but then , of course , she be and not french . " but madame be pay little heed to the gossip of the dressmaker . her eye be fix upon the statue in the corner , and her lip be move in that she might be worthy of this great destiny which have come so suddenly upon her , a poor governess ; that she might walk straight among the pitfall which surround her upon every side ; that this night 's work might bring a blessing upon and upon the man whom she love . there come a discreet tap at the door to break in upon her prayer . " it be , madame , " say mademoiselle . " he say that the king be ready . " " then we shall not keep him wait . come , mademoiselle , and may shed his blessing upon what we be about to do ! " the little party assemble in the king 's , and start from there to the private chapel . in front walk the portly bishop , clad in a green vestment , puff out with the importance of the function , his missal in his hand , and his finger between the page at the service de . beside him stride his almoner , and two little servitor of the court in crimson cassock bear lighted torch . the king and madame walk side by side , she quiet and compose , with gentle bearing and downcast eye , he with a flush on his dark cheek , and a nervous , furtive look in his eye , like a man who know that he be in the midst of one of the great crisis of his life . behind them , in solemn silence , follow a little group of chosen witness , the lean , silent la , , scowl heavily at the bride , the , , and mademoiselle . the torch shed a strong yellow light upon this small band as they advance slowly through the corridor and salon which lead to the chapel , and they throw a garish glare upon the painted wall and ceiling , flash back from and from mirror , but leave long trail shadow in the corner . the king glance nervously at these black recess , and at the portrait of his ancestor and relation which line the wall . as he pass that of his late queen , , he start and gasp with horror . " ! " he whisper ; " she frown and spit at me ! " madame lay her cool hand upon his wrist . " it be nothing , sire , " she murmur , in her soothing voice . " it be but the light flicker over the picture . " her word have their usual effect upon him . the startle look die away from his eye , and take her hand in his he walk resolutely forwards . a minute later they be before the altar , and the word be be read which should bind them forever together . as they turn away again , her new ring blaze upon her finger , there be a buzz of congratulation around her . the king only say nothing , but he look at her , and she have no wish that he should say more . she be still calm and pale , but the blood throb in her temple . " you be of now , " it seem to be , queen , queen ! " but a sudden shadow have fall across her , and a low voice be in her ear . " remember your promise to the church , " it whisper . she start , and turn to see the pale , eager face of the jesuit beside her . " your hand have turn cold , , " say . " let us go , dear . we have be too long in this dismal church . " madame have retire to rest , easy in her mind , after receive the message from her brother . she know as few other know him , and she be well aware of that obstinacy in trifle which be one of his characteristic . if he have say that he would be marry by the archbishop , then the archbishop it must be ; , at least , there should be no marriage . be a new day , and if it do not shake the king 's plan , then indeed she must have lose her wit as well as her beauty . she dress herself with care in the morning , put on her powder , her little touch of rouge , her one patch near the dimple of her cheek , her loose robe of violet velvet , and her of pearl with all the solicitude of a warrior , who be brace on his arm for a life and death contest . no news have come to her of the great event of the previous night , although the court already ring with it , for her haughtiness and her bitter tongue have leave her without a friend or intimate . she rise , therefore , in the good of spirit , with her mind set on the one question as to how best she could gain an audience with the king . she be still in her boudoir put the last touch to her toilet when her page announce to her that the king be wait in her salon . madame could hardly believe in such good fortune . she have rack her brain all morning as to how she should win her way to him , and here he be wait for her . with a last glance at the mirror , she hasten to meet him . he be stand with his back turn , look up at one of 's painting , when she enter ; but as she close the door , he turn and take two step towards her . she have run forward with a pretty little cry of joy , her white arm outstretch , and love shine on her face ; but he put out his hand , gently and yet with decision , with a gesture which check her approach . her hand drop to her side , her lip tremble , and she stand look at him with her grief and her fear all speak loudly from her eye . there be a look upon his feature which she have never see before , and already something be whisper at the back of her soul that at least his spirit be strong than her own . " you be angry with me again , " she cry . he have come with every intention of begin the interview by tell her bluntly of his marriage ; but now , as he look upon her beauty and her love , he feel that it would have be less brutal to strike her down at his foot . let some one else tell her , then . she would know soon enough . besides , there would be less chance then of a scene , which be a thing abhorrent to his soul . his task be , in any case , quite difficult enough . all this run swiftly through his mind , and she as swiftly read it off in the brown eye which gaze at her . " you have something you come to say , and now you have not the heart to say it . bless the kindly heart which check the cruel tongue . " " no , no , madame , " say ; " i would not be cruel . i can forget that my life have be brighten and my court make brilliant during all these year by your wit and your beauty . but time change , madame , and i owe a duty to the world which override my own personal inclination . for every reason i think that it be good that we should arrange in the way which we discuss the other day , and that you should withdraw yourself from the court . " " withdraw , sire ! for how long ? " " it must be a permanent withdrawal , madame . " she stand with clench hand and a pale face stare at him . " i need not say that i shall make your retirement a happy one as far as in me lie . your allowance shall be fix by yourself ; a palace shall be erect for you in whatever part of you may prefer , provide that it be twenty mile from . an estate -- " " oh , sire , how can you think that such thing as these would compensate me for the loss of your love ? " her heart have turn to lead within her breast . have he speak hotly and angrily she might have hope to turn him as she have do before ; but this gentle and yet firm bearing be new to him , and she feel that all her art be vain against it . his coolness enrage her , and yet she strive to choke down her passion and to preserve the humble attitude which be least natural to her haughty and vehement spirit ; but soon the effort become too much for her . " madame , " say he , " i have think well over this matter , and it must be as i say . there be no other way at all . since we must part , the parting have well be short and sharp . believe me , it be no pleasant matter for me either . i have order your brother to have his carriage at the postern at nine o'clock , for i think that perhaps you would wish to retire after nightfall . " " to hide my shame from a laughing court ! it be thoughtful of you , sire . and yet , perhaps , this too be a duty , since we hear so much of duty nowadays , for who be it but -- " " i know , madame , i know . i confess it . i have wrong you deeply . believe me that every atonement which be in my power shall be make . nay , do not look so angrily at me , i beg . let our last sight of each other be one which may leave a pleasant memory behind it . " " a pleasant memory ! " all the gentleness and humility have fall from her now , and her voice have the hard ring of contempt and of anger . " a pleasant memory ! it may well be pleasant to you , who be release from the woman whom you ruin , who can turn now to another without any pale face to be see within the salon of your court to remind you of your perfidy . but to me , pine in some lonely country house , spurn by my husband , despise by my family , the scorn and jest of , far from all which give a charm to life , far from the man for whose love i have sacrifice will be a very pleasant memory to me , you may be sure ! " the king 's eye have catch the angry gleam which shoot from hers , and yet he strive hard to set a curb upon his temper . when such a matter have to be discuss between the proud man and the haughty woman in all , one or the other must yield a point . he feel that it be for him to do so , and yet it do not come kindly to his imperious nature . " there be nothing to be gain , madame , " say he , " by use word which be neither seemly for your tongue nor for my ear . you will do me the justice to confess that where i might command i be now entreat , and that instead of order you as my subject , i be persuade you as my friend . " " oh , you show too much consideration , sire ! our relation of twenty year or so can scarce suffice to explain such forbearance from you . i should indeed be grateful that you have not set your archer of the guard upon me , or march me from the palace between a file of your musketeer . sire , how can i thank you for this forbearance ? " she curtsy low , with her face set in a mock smile . " your word be bitter , madame . " " my heart be bitter , sire . " " , , be reasonable , i implore you . we have both leave our youth behind . " " the allusion to my year come gratefully from your lip . " " ah , you distort my word . then i shall say no more . you may not see me again , madame . be there no question which you would wish to ask me before i go ? " " good ! " she cry ; " be this a man ? have it a heart ? be these the lip which have tell me so often that he love me ? be these the eye which have look so fondly into mine ? can you then thrust away a woman whose life have be yours as you put away the palace when a more showy one be ready for you ? and this be the end of all those vow , those sweet whisper , those persuasion , those ! " " , madame , this be painful to both of us . " " pain ! where be the pain in your face ? i see anger in it because i have dare to speak truth ; i see joy in it because you feel that your vile task be do . but where be the pain ? ah , when i be go all will be so easy to it not ? you can go back then to your -- " " madame ! " " yes , yes , you can frighten me ! what do i care for all that you can do ! but i know all . do not think that i be blind . and so you would even have marry her ! you , the descendant of , and she the widow , the poor drudge whom in charity i take into my household ! ah , how your courtier will smile ! how the little poet will scribble ! how the wit will whisper ! you do not hear of these thing , of course , but they be a little painful for your friend . " " my patience can bear no more , " cry the king furiously . " i leave you , madame , and forever . " but her fury have sweep all fear and discretion from her mind . she step between the door and him , her face flush , her eye blaze , her face thrust a little forward , one small white satin slipper tap upon the carpet . " you be in haste , sire ! she be wait for you , doubtless . " " let me pass , madame . " " but it be a disappointment last night , be it not , my poor sire ? ah , and for the governess , what a blow ! great heaven , what a blow ! no archbishop ! no marriage ! all the pretty plan go wrong ! be it not cruel ? " gaze at the beautiful furious face in bewilderment , and it flash across his mind that perhaps her grief have turn her brain . what else could be the meaning of this wild talk of the archbishop and the disappointment ? it would be unworthy of him to speak harshly to one who be so afflict . he must soothe her , and , above all , he must get away from her . " you have have the keep of a good many of my family jewel , " say he . " i beg that you will still retain them as a small sign of my regard . " he have hope to please her and to calm her , but in an instant she be over at her hurl double handful of precious stone down at his foot . they clink and rattle , the little pellet of red and yellow and green , rolling , glint over the floor and rap up against the oak panel at the base of the wall . " they will do for the governess if the archbishop come at last , " she cry . he be more convince than ever that she have lose her wit . a thought strike him by which he might appeal to all that be soft and more gentle in her nature . he step swiftly to the door , push it half open , and give a whisper order . a youth with long golden hair wave down over his black velvet doublet enter the room . it be her young son , the of . " i think that you would wish to bid him farewell , " say . she stand stare as though unable to realise the significance of his word . then it be bear suddenly in upon her that her child as well as her lover be to be take from her , that this other woman should see them and speak with them and win their love while she be far away . all that be evil and bitter in the woman flash suddenly up in her , until for the instant she be what the king have think her . if her son be not for her , then he should be for none . a jewel knife lie among her treasure , ready to her hand . she catch it up and rush at the cower lad . scream and run forward to stop her ; but another have be swift than he . a woman have dart through the open door , and have catch the upraise wrist . there be a moment 's struggle , two queenly figure sway and strain , and the knife drop between their foot . the frightened catch it up , and seize his little son by the wrist , he rush from the apartment . stagger back against the ottoman to find herself confront by the steady eye and set face of that other , the woman whose presence fall like a shadow at every turn of her life . " i have save you , madame , from do that which you would have be the first to bewail . " " save me ! it be you who have drive me to this ! " the fall favourite lean against the high back of the ottoman , her hand rest behind her upon the curve of the velvet . her lid be half close on her flash eye , and her lip just part to show a gleam of her white tooth . here be the true , a feline creature crouch for a spring , very far from that humble and soft-spoken who have win the king back by her gentle word . madame 's hand have be cut in the struggle , and the blood be drip down from the end of her finger , but neither woman have time to spare a thought upon that . her firm gray eye be fix upon her former rival as one fix them upon some weak and treacherous creature who may be dominate by a strong will . " yes , it be you who have drive me to , whom i pick up when you be hard press for a crust of bread or a cup of sour wine . what have you ? you have except a name which be a laughing-stock . and what do i give you ? i give you everything . you know that i give you everything . money , position , the entrance to the court . you have them all from me . and now you mock me ! " " madame , i do not mock you . i pity you from the bottom of my heart . " " pity ? ! ! a be pity by the widow ! your pity may go where your gratitude be , and where your character be . we shall be trouble with it no longer then . " " your word do not pain me . " " i can believe that you be not sensitive . " " not when my conscience be at ease . " " ah ! it have not trouble you , then ? " " not upon this point , madame . " " ! how terrible must those other point have be ! " " i have never have an evil thought towards you . " " none towards me ? oh , woman , woman ! " " what have i do , then ? the king come to my room to see the child teach . he stay . he talk . he ask my opinion on this and that . could i be silent ? or could i say other than what i think ? " " you turn him against me ! " " i should be proud indeed if i think that i have turn him to virtue . " " the word come well from your lip . " " i would that i hear it upon yours . " " and so , by your own confession , you steal the king 's love from me , most virtuous of widow ! " " i have all gratitude and kindly think for you . you have , as you have so often remind me , be my benefactress . it be not necessary for you to say it , for i have never for an instant forget it . yet if the king have ask me what i think , i will not deny to you that i have say that sin be sin , and that he would be a worthy man if he shake off the guilty bond which hold him . " " or exchange them for other . " " for those of duty . " " ! your hypocrisy sicken me ! if you pretend to be a nun , why be you not where the nun be ? you would have the good of two -- would you not ? -- all that the court can give , and yet ape the manner of the cloister . but you need not do it with me ! i know you as your inmost heart know you . i be honest , and what i do , i do before the world . you , behind your priest and your director and your prie-dieu and your you think that you deceive me , as you deceive other ? " her antagonist 's gray eye sparkle for the first time , and she take a quick step forward , with one white hand half lift in rebuke . " you may speak as you will of me , " say she . " to me it be no more than the foolish paroquet that chatter in your . but do not touch upon thing which be sacred . ah , if you would but raise your own thought to such you would but turn them inwards , and see , before it be too late , how vile and foul be this life which you have lead ! what might you not have do ? his soul be in your hand like clay for the potter . if you have raise him up , if you have lead him on the high path , if you have bring out all that be noble and good within him , how your name would have be love and bless , from the chateau to the cottage ! but no ; you drag him down ; you waste his youth ; you draw him from his wife ; you mar his manhood . a crime in one so high beget a thousand other in those who look to him for an example ; and all , all be upon your soul . take heed , madame , for 's sake take heed ere it be too late ! for all your beauty , there can be for you , as for me , a few short year of life . then , when that brown hair be white , when that white cheek be sunken , when that bright eye be , then pity the soul of ! " her rival have sink her head for the moment before the solemn word and the beautiful eye . for an instant she stand silent , cow for the first time in all her life ; but then the mock , defiant spirit come back to her , and she glance up with a curling lip . " i be already provide with a spiritual director , thank you , " say she . " oh , madame , you must not think to throw dust in my eye ! i know you , and know you well ! " " on the contrary , you seem to know less than i have expect . if you know me so well , pray what be i ? " all her rival 's bitterness and hatred ring in the tone of her answer . " you be , " say she , " the governess of my child , and the secret mistress of the king . " " you be mistake , " answer madame serenely . " i be the governess of your child , and i be the king 's wife . " often have feign a faint in the day when she wish to disarm the anger of the king . so she have draw his arm round her , and win the pity which be the twin sister of love . but now she know what it be to have the sense strike out of her by a word . she could not doubt the truth of what she hear . there be that in her rival 's face , in her steady eye , in her quiet voice , which carry absolute conviction with it . she stand stun for an instant , pant , her outstretch hand feel at the air , her defiant eye dull and glaze . then , with a short sharp cry , the wail of one who have fight hard and yet know that she can fight no more , her proud head droop , and she fall forward senseless at the foot of her rival . madame stoop and raise her up in her strong white arm . there be true grief and pity in her eye as she look down at the face which lie against her bosom , all the bitterness and pride go out of it , and nothing leave save the tear which sparkle under the dark lash , and the petulant droop of the lip , like that of a child which have weep itself to sleep . she lay her on the ottoman and place a silken cushion under her head . then she gather together and put back into the open cupboard all the jewel which be scatter about the carpet . have lock it , and place the key on the table where its owner 's eye would readily fall upon it , she strike a gong , which summon the little black page . " your mistress be indispose , " say she . " go and bring her maid to her . " and so , have do all that lay with her to do , she turn away from the great silent room , where , amid the velvet and the gilding , her beautiful rival lie like a crushed flower , helpless and hopeless . helpless enough , for what could she do ? and hopeless too , for how could fortune aid her ? the instant that her sense have come back to her she have send away her wait woman , and lay with clasp hand and a draw face plan out her own weary future . she must go ; that be certain . not merely because it be the king 's order , but because only misery and mockery remain for her now in the palace where she have reign supreme . it be true that she have hold her position against the queen before , but all her hatred could not blind her to the fact that her rival be a very different woman to poor meek little . no ; her spirit be break at last . she must accept defeat , and she must go . she rise from the couch , feel that she have age ten year in an hour . there be much to be do , and little time in which to do it . she have cast down her jewel when the king have speak as though they would atone for the loss of his love ; but now that the love be go there be no reason why the jewel should be lose too . if she have cease to be the most powerful , she might still be the rich woman in . there be her pension , of course . that would be a munificent one , for be always generous . and then there be all the spoil which she have collect during these long jewel the pearl , the gold , the vase , the picture , the crucifix , the watch , the they represent many million of livre . with her own hand she pack away the more precious and portable of them , while she arrange with her brother for the safe-keeping of the other . all day she be at work in a mood of feverish energy , do anything and everything which might distract her thought from her own defeat and her rival 's victory . by evening all be ready , and she have arrange that her property should be send after her to , to which castle she intend to retire . it want half an hour of the time fix for her departure , when a young cavalier , whose face be strange to her , be usher into the room . he come with a message from her brother . " monsieur regret , madame , that the rumour of your departure have get abroad among the court . " " what do i care for that , monsieur ? " she retort , with all her old spirit . " he say , madame , that the courtier may assemble at the west gate to see you go ; that madame will be there , and the , and mademoiselle , -- " the lady shrink with horror at the thought of such an ordeal . to drive away from the palace , where she have be more than queen , under the scornful eye and bitter gibe of so many personal enemy ! after all the humiliation of the day , that would be the crown cup of sorrow . her nerve be break . she could not face it . " tell my brother , monsieur , that i should be much oblige if he would make fresh arrangement , by which my departure might be private . " " he bid me say that he have do so , madame . " " ah ! at what hour then ? " " now . as soon as possible . " " i be ready . at the west gate then ? " " no ; at the east . the carriage wait . " " and where be my brother ? " " we be to pick him up at the park gate . " " and why that ? " " because he be watch ; and be he see beside the carriage , all would be know . " " very good . then , monsieur , if you will take my cloak and this casket we may start at once . " they make their way by a circuitous route through the corridor , she hurry on like a guilty creature , a hood draw over her face , and her heart in a flutter at every stray footfall . but fortune stand her friend . she meet no one , and soon find herself at the eastern postern gate . a couple of phlegmatic swiss guardsman lean upon their musket upon either side , and the lamp above shine upon the carriage which await her . the door be open , and a tall cavalier swathe in a black cloak hand her into it . he then take the seat opposite to her , slam the door , and the caleche rattle away down the main drive . it have not surprise her that this man should join her inside the coach , for it be usual to have a guard there , and he be doubtless take the place which her brother would afterwards occupy . that be all natural enough . but when ten minute pass by , and he have neither move nor speak , she peer at him through the gloom with some curiosity . in the glance which she have of him , as he hand her in , she have see that he be dress like a gentleman , and there be that in his bow and wave as he do it which tell her experienced sense that he be a man of courtly manner . but courtier , as she have know them , be gallant and garrulous , and this man be so very quiet and still . again she strain her eye through the gloom . his hat be pull down and his cloak be still draw across his mouth , but from out of the shadow she seem to get a glimpse of two eye which peer at her even as she do at him . at last the silence impress her with a vague uneasiness . it be time to bring it to an end . " surely , monsieur , we have pass the park gate where we be to pick up my brother . " her companion neither answer nor move . she think that perhaps the rumble of the heavy caleche have drown her voice . " i say , monsieur , " she repeat , lean forwards , " that we have pass the place where we be to meet monsieur . " he take no notice . " monsieur , " she cry , " i again remark that we have pass the gate . " there be no answer . a thrill run through her nerve . who or what could he be , this silent man ? then suddenly it strike her that he might be dumb . " perhaps monsieur be afflict , " she say . " perhaps monsieur can speak . if that be the cause of your silence , will you raise your hand , and i shall understand . " he sit rigid and silent . then a sudden mad fear come upon her , shut up in the dark with this dreadful voiceless thing . she scream in her terror , and strive to pull down the window and open the door . but a grip of steel close suddenly round her wrist and force her back into her seat . and yet the man 's body have not move , and there be no sound save the lurch and rasp of the carriage and the clatter of the fly horse . they be already out on the country road far beyond . it be dark than before , heavy cloud have bank over the heaven , and the rumble of thunder be hear low down on the horizon . the lady lie back pant upon the leather cushion of the carriage . she be a brave woman , and yet this sudden strange horror come upon her at the moment when she be weak have shake her to the soul . she crouch in the corner , stare across with eye which be dilate with terror at the figure on the other side . if he would but say something ! any revelation , any menace , be good than this silence . it be so dark now that she could hardly see his vague outline , and every instant , as the storm gather , it become still dark . the wind be blow in little short angry puff , and still there be that far-off rattle and rumble . again the strain of the silence be unbearable . she must break it at any cost . " , " say she , " there be some mistake here . i do not know by what right you prevent me from pull down the window and give my direction to the coachman . " he say nothing . " i repeat , sir , that there be some mistake . this be the carriage of my brother , monsieur , and he be not a man who will allow his sister to be treat . " a few heavy drop of rain splash against one window . the cloud be low and dense . she have quite lose sight of that motionless figure , but it be all the more terrible to her now that it be unseen . she scream with sheer terror , but her scream avail no more than her word . " , " she cry , clutch forward with her hand and grasp his sleeve , " you frighten me . you terrify me . i have never harm you . why should you wish to hurt an unfortunate woman ? oh , speak to me ; for 's sake , speak ! " still the patter of rain upon the window , and no other sound save her own sharp breathing . " perhaps you do not know who i be ! " she continue , endeavour to assume her usual tone of command , and talk now to an absolute and impenetrable darkness . " you may learn when it be too late that you have choose the wrong person for this pleasantry . i be the , and i be not one who forget a slight . if you know anything of the court , you must know that my word have some weight with the king . you may carry me away in this carriage , but i be not a person who can disappear without speedy inquiry , and speedy vengeance if i have be wrong . if you , ! have mercy ! " a livid flash of lightning have burst from the heart of the cloud , and , for an instant , the whole and the interior of the caleche be as light as day . the man 's face be within a hand 's breadth of her own , his mouth wide open , his eye mere shine slit , convulse with silent merriment . every detail flash out clear in that vivid -- his red quiver tongue , the light pink beneath it , the broad white tooth , the short brown beard cut into a peak and bristle forward . but it be not the sudden flash , it be not the laughing , cruel face , which shoot an ice-cold shudder through . it be that , of all man upon earth , this be he whom she most dread , and whom she have least think to see . " ! " she scream . " ! it be you ! " " yes , little , it be i. we be restore to each other 's arm , you see , after this interval . " " oh , , how you have frighten me ! how could you be so cruel ? why would you not speak to me ? " " because it be so sweet to sit in silence and to think that i really have you to myself after all these year , with none to come between . ah , little , i have often long for this hour . " " i have wrong you , ; i have wrong you ! forgive me ! " " we do not forgive in our family , my darling . be it not like old day to find ourselves drive together ? and in this carriage , too . it be the very one which bear us back from the cathedral where you make your vow so prettily . i sit as i sit now , and you sit there , and i take your hand like this , and i press it , -- " " oh , villain , you have twist my wrist ! you have break my arm ! " " oh , surely not , my little ! and then you remember that , as you tell me how truly you would love me , i lean forward to your lip , -- " " oh , help ! brute , you have cut my mouth ! you have strike me with your ring . " " strike you ! now who would have think that spring day when we plan out our future , that this also be in the future wait for me and you ? and this ! and this ! " he strike savagely at her face in the darkness . she throw herself down , her head press against the cushion . with the strength and fury of a maniac he shower his blow above her , thud upon the leather or crash upon the woodwork , heedless of his own splinter hand . " so i have silence you , " say he at last . " i have stop your word with my kiss before now . but the world go on , , and time change , and woman grow false , and man grow stern . " " you may kill me if you will , " she moan . " i will , " he say simply . still the carriage fly along , jolt and stagger in the country road . the storm have pass , but the growl of the thunder and the far-off glint of a be to be hear and see on the other side of the heaven . the moon shine out with its clear cold light , silver the broad , , plain , and shine through the window of the carriage upon the crouch figure and her terrible companion . he lean back now , his arm fold upon his chest , his eye gloat upon the abject misery of the woman who have wrong him . " where be you take me ? " she ask at last . " to , my little . " " and why there ? what would you do to me ? " " i would silence that little lie tongue forever . it shall deceive no more man . " " you would murder me ? " " if you call it that . " " you have a stone for a heart . " " my other be give to a woman . " " oh , my sin be indeed punish . " " rest assure that they will be . " " can i do nothing to atone ? " " i will see that you atone . " " you have a sword by your side , . why do you not kill me , then , if you be so bitter against me ? why do you not pass it through my heart ? " " rest assure that i would have do so have i not an excellent reason . " " why , then ? " " i will tell you . at i have the right of the high justice , the middle , and the low . i be seigneur there , and can try , condemn , and execute . it be my lawful privilege . this pitiful king will not even know how to avenge you , for the right be mine , and he can gainsay it without make an enemy of every seigneur in . " he open his mouth again and laugh at his own device , while she , shiver in every limb , turn away from his cruel face and glowing eye , and bury her face in her hand . once more she pray to forgive her for her poor sinful life . so they whirl through the night behind the clatter horse , the husband and the wife , say nothing , but with hatred and fear rage in their heart , until a brazier fire shine down upon them from the angle of a keep , and the shadow of the huge pile loom vaguely up in front of them in the darkness . it be the of . and thus it be that and see from their dungeon window the midnight carriage which discharge its prisoner before their eye . hence , too , come that ominous planking and that strange procession in the early morning . and thus it also happen that they find themselves look down upon as she be lead to her death , and that they hear that last piteous cry for aid at the instant when the heavy hand of the ruffian with the axe fall upon her shoulder , and she be force down upon her knee beside the block . she shrink scream from the dreadful , , greasy billet of wood , but the butcher heave up his weapon , and the seigneur have take a step forward with hand outstretch to seize the long auburn hair and to drag the dainty head down with it when suddenly he be strike motionless with astonishment , and stand with his foot advance and his hand still out , his mouth half open , and his eye fix in front of him . and , indeed , what he have see be enough to fill any man with amazement . out of the small square window which face him a man have suddenly shoot , pitch on to his outstretch hand and then bound to his foot . within a foot of his heel come the head of a second one , who fall more heavily than the first , and yet recover himself as quickly . the one wear the blue coat with silver facing of the king 's guard ; the second have the dark coat and clean-shaven face of a man of peace ; but each carry a short rusty iron bar in his hand . not a word do either of them say , but the soldier take two quick step forward and strike at the headsman while he be still poise himself for a blow at the victim . there be a thud , with a crackle like a breaking egg , and the bar fly into piece . the give a dreadful cry , and drop his axe , clap his two hand to his head , and run zigzag across the scaffold , fall over , a dead man , into the courtyard beneath . quick as a flash have catch up the axe , and face with the heavy weapon sling over his shoulder and a challenge in his eye . " now ! " say he . the seigneur have for the instant be too astound to speak . now he understand at least that these stranger have come between him and his prey . " seize these man ! " he shriek , turn to his follower . " one moment ! " cry , with a voice and manner which command attention . " you see by my coat what i be . i be the body-servant of the king . who touch me touch him . have a care for . it be a dangerous game ! " " on , you coward ! " roar . but the man-at-arms hesitate , for the fear of the king be as a great shadow which hang over all . see their indecision , and he follow up his advantage . " this woman , " he cry , " be the king 's own favourite , and if any harm come to a lock of her hair , i tell you that there be not a live soul within this portcullis who will not die a death of torture . fool , will you gasp out your life upon the rack , or writhe in boil oil , at the bidding of this madman ? " " who be these man , ? " cry the seigneur furiously . " they be prisoner , your excellency . " " prisoner ! whose prisoner ? " " yours , your excellency . " " who order you to detain them ? " " you do . the escort bring your signet-ring . " " i never see the man . there be devilry in this . but they shall not beard me in my own castle , nor stand between me and my own wife . no , par ! they shall not and live ! you man , , , , , , all you who have eat my bread , on to them , i say ! " he glance round with furious eye , but they fall only upon hung head and avert face . with a hideous curse he flash out his sword and rush at his wife , who kneel half insensible beside the block . spring between them to protect her ; but , the bearded seneschal , have already seize his master round the waist . with the strength of a maniac , his tooth clench and the foam churning from the corner of his lip , writhe round in the man 's grasp , and shorten his sword , he thrust it through the brown beard and deep into the throat behind it . fall back with a choke cry , the blood bubble from his mouth and his wound ; but before his murderer could disengage his weapon , and the , aid by a dozen of the retainer , have drag him down on to the scaffold , and have pinion him so securely that he could but move his eye and his lip , with which he lie glare and spit at them . so savage be his own follower against be well love amongst -- that , with axe and block so ready , justice might very swiftly have have her way , have not a long clear , rise and fall in a thousand little twirl and flourish , clang out suddenly in the still morning air . prick up his ear at the sound of it like a hound at the huntsman 's call . " do you hear , ? " " it be a trumpet . " " it be the guard ' . you , there , hasten to the gate ! throw up the portcullis and drop the drawbridge ! stir , or even now you may suffer for your master 's sin ! it have be a narrow escape , ! " " you may say so , friend . i see him put out his hand to her hair , even as you spring from the window . another instant and he would have have her scalp . but she be a fair woman , the fair that ever my eye rest upon , and it be not fit that she should kneel here upon these board . " he drag her husband 's long black cloak from him , and make a pillow for the senseless woman with a tenderness and delicacy which come strangely from a man of his build and bearing . he be still stoop over her when there come the clang of the fall bridge , and an instant later the clatter of the hoof of a troop of cavalry , who sweep with wave of plume , toss of mane , and jingle of steel into the courtyard . at the head be a tall horseman in the full dress of the guard , with a curl feather in his hat , high buff glove , and his sword gleam in the sunlight . he canter forward towards the scaffold , his keen dark eye take in every detail of the group which await him there . 's face brighten at the sight of him , and he be down in an instant beside his stirrup . " ! " " ! now where in the name of wonder do you come from ? " " i have be a prisoner . tell me , , do you leave the message in ? " " certainly i do . " " and the archbishop come ? " " he do . " " and the marriage ? " " take place as arrange . that be why this poor woman whom i see yonder have have to leave the palace . " " i think as much . " " i trust that no harm have come to her ? " " my friend and i be just in time to save her . her husband lie there . he be a fiend , . " " very likely ; but an angel might have grow bitter have he have the same treatment . " " we have him pinion here . he have slay a man , and i have slay another . " " on my word , you have be busy . " " how do you know that we be here ? " " , that be an unexpected pleasure . " " you do not come for us , then ? " " no ; we come for the lady . " " and how do this fellow get hold of her ? " " her brother be to have take her in his carriage . her husband learn it , and by a lie message he coax her into his own , which be at another door . when find that she do not come , and that her room be empty , he make inquiry , and soon learn how she have go . 's arm have be see on the panel , and so the king send me here with my troop as fast as we could gallop . " " ah , and you would have come too late have a strange chance not bring us here . i know not who it be who waylay us , for this man seem to know nothing of the matter . however , all that will be clear afterwards . what be to be do now ? " " i have my own order . madame be to be send to , and any who be concern in offer her violence be to be keep until the king 's pleasure be know . the castle , too , must be hold for the king . but you , , you have nothing to do now ? " " nothing , save that i would like well to ride into to see that all be right with my uncle and his daughter . " " ah , that sweet little cousin of thine ! by my soul , i do not wonder that the folk know you well in the . well , i have carry a message for you once , and you shall do as much for me now . " " with all my heart . and whither ? " " to . the king will be on fire to know how we have fare . you have the good right to tell him , since without you and your friend yonder it would have be but a sorry tale . " " i will be there in two hour . " " have you horse ? " " ours be slay . " " you will find some in the stable here . pick the good , since you have lose your own in the king 's service . " the advice be too good to be overlook . , beckon to , hurry away with him to the stable , while , with a few short sharp order , disarm the retainer , station his guardsman all over the castle , and arrange for the removal of the lady , and for the custody of her husband . an hour later the two friend be ride swiftly down the country road , inhale the sweet air , which seem the fresher for their late experience of the dank , foul vapour of their dungeon . far behind them a little dark pinnacle jut over a grove of tree mark the chateau which they have leave , while on the extreme horizon to the west there come a quick shimmer and sparkle where the level ray of the early sun gleam upon the magnificent palace which be their goal . two day after madame 's marriage to the king there be hold within the humble wall of her little room a meeting which be destine to cause untold misery to many hundred of thousand of people , and yet , in the wisdom of , to be an instrument in carry french art and french ingenuity and french sprightliness among those heavy teutonic people who have be the strong and the well ever since for the leaven which they then receive . for in history great evil have sometimes arise from a virtue , and most beneficent result have often follow hard upon a crime . the time have come when the church be to claim her promise from madame , and her pale cheek and sad eye show how vain it have be for her to try and drown the pleading of her tender heart by the argument of the bigot around her . she know the huguenot of . who could know them good , see that she be herself from their stock , and have be bring up in their faith ? she know their patience , their nobility , their independence , their tenacity . what chance be there that they would conform to the king 's wish ? a few great noble might , but the other would laugh at the galley , the jail , or even the gallows when the faith of their father be at stake . if their creed be no longer tolerate , then , and if they remain true to it , they must either fly from the country or spend a live death tug at an oar or work in a chain-gang upon the road . it be a dreadful alternative to present to a people who be so numerous that they make a small nation in themselves . and most dreadful of all , that she who be of their own blood should cast her voice against them . and yet her promise have be give , and now the time have come when it must be redeem . the eloquent be there , with , the minister of war , and the famous jesuit , , each pile argument upon argument to overcome the reluctance of the king . beside them stand another priest , so thin and so pale that he might have rise from his bed of death , but with a fierce light burning in his large dark eye , and with a terrible resolution in his draw brow and in the set of his grim , lanky jaw . madame bent over her tapestry and weave her coloured silk in silence , while the king lean upon his hand and listen with the face of a man who know that he be drive , and yet can hardly turn against the goad . on the low table lie a paper , with pen and ink beside it . it be the order for the revocation , and it only need the king 's signature to make it the law of the land . " and so , father , you be of opinion that if i stamp out heresy in this fashion i shall assure my own salvation in the next world ? " he ask . " you will have merit a reward . " " and you think so too , monsieur ? " " assuredly , sire . " " and you . du ? " the emaciate priest speak for the first time , a tinge of colour creep into his cheek , and a more lurid light in his deep-set eye . " i know not about assure your salvation , sire . i think it would take very much more to do that . but there can be a doubt as to your damnation if you do not do it . " the king start angrily , and frown at the speaker . " your word be somewhat more curt than i be accustom to , " he remark . " in such a matter it be cruel indeed to leave you in doubt . i say again that your soul 's fate hang upon the balance . heresy be a mortal sin . thousand of heretic would turn to the church if you do but give the word . therefore these thousand of mortal sin be all upon your soul . what hope for it then , if you do not amend ? " " my father and my grandfather tolerate them . " " then , without some special extension of the grace of , your father and your grandfather be burn in hell . " " insolent ! " the king spring from his seat . " sire , i will say what i hold to be the truth be you fifty time a king . what care i for any man when i know that i speak for the king of king ? see ; be these the limb of one who would shrink from testify to truth ? " with a sudden movement he throw back the long sleeve of his gown and shoot out his white arm . the bone be all knot and bend and screw into the most fantastic shape . even , the hardened man of the court , and his two brother priest , shudder at the sight of those dreadful limb . he raise them above his head and turn his burning eye upwards . " heaven have choose me to testify for the faith before now , " say he . " i hear that blood be want to nourish the young church of , and so to i journey . they tear me open ; they crucify me ; they wrench and split my bone . i be leave as a dead man , yet have breathe the breath of life back into me that i may help in this great work of the regeneration of . " " your suffering , father , " say , resume his seat , " give you every claim , both upon the and upon me , who be its special champion and protector . what would you counsel , then , father , in the case of those huguenot who refuse to change ? " " they would change , " cry , with a draw smile upon his ghastly face . " they must bend or they must break . what matter if they be grind to powder , if we can but build up a complete church in the land ? " his deep-set eye glow with ferocity , and be shake one bony hand in savage wrath above his head . " the cruelty with which you have be use , then , have not teach you to be more tender to other . " " tender ! to heretic ! no , sire , my own pain have teach me that the world and the flesh be as nothing , and that the true charity to another be to capture his soul at all risk to his vile body . i should have these huguenot soul , sire , though i turn into a shambles to gain them . " be evidently deeply impress by the fearless word and the wild earnestness of the speaker . he lean his head upon his hand for a little time , and remain sink in the deep thought . " besides , sire , " say softly , " there would be little need for these strong measure of which the good speak . as i have already remark to you , you be so beloved in your kingdom that the mere assurance that you have express your will upon the subject would be enough to turn them all to the true faith . " " i wish that i could think so , father ; i wish that i could think so . but what be this ? " it be his valet who have half open the door . " be here , who desire to see you at once , sire . " " ask the captain to enter . ah ! " a happy thought seem to have strike him . " we shall see what love for me will do in such a matter , for if it be anywhere to be find it must be among my own body-servant . " the guardsman have arrive that instant from his long ride , and leave with the horse , he have come on at once , all dusty and travel-stained , to carry his message to the king . he enter now , and stand with the quiet ease of a man who be use to such scene , his hand raise in a salute . " what news , captain ? " " bid me tell you , sire , that he hold the of , that the lady be safe , and that her husband be a prisoner . " and his wife exchange a quick glance of relief . " that be well , " say he . " by the way , captain , you have serve me in many way of late , and always with success . i hear , , that be dead of the . " " he die yesterday , sire . " " then i desire that you make out the vacant commission of major to monsieur . let me be the first to congratulate you , major , upon your promotion , though you will need to exchange the blue coat for the pearl and gray of the . we can spare you from the household , you see . " kiss the hand which the monarch hold out to him . " may i be worthy of your kindness , sire ! " " you would do what you could to serve me , would you not ? " " my life be yours , sire . " " very good . then i shall put your fidelity to the proof . " " i be ready for any proof . " " it be not a very severe one . you see this paper upon the table . it be an order that all the huguenot in my dominions shall give up their error , under pain of banishment or captivity . now i have hope that there be many of my faithful subject who be at fault in this matter , but who will abjure it when they learn that it be my clearly express wish that they should do so . it would be a great joy to me to find that it be so , for it would be a pain to me to use force against any man who bear the name of frenchman . do you follow me ? " " yes , sire . " the young man have turn deadly pale , and he shift his foot , and open and clasp his hand . he have face death a dozen time and under many different form , but never have he feel such a sinking of the heart as come over him now . " you be yourself a huguenot , i understand . i would gladly have you , then , as the of this great measure . let us hear from your own lip that you , for one , be ready to follow the lead of your king in this as in other thing . " the young guardsman still hesitate , though his doubt be rather as to how he should frame his reply than as to what its substance should be . he feel that in an instant have wipe out all the good turn which she have do him during his past life , and that now , far from be in her debt , he hold a heavy score against her . the king arch his eyebrow and drum his finger impatiently as he glance at the downcast face and dejected bearing . " why all this thought ? " he cry . " you be a man whom i have raise and whom i will raise . he who have a major 's epaulette at thirty may carry a marshal 's baton at fifty . your past be mine , and your future shall be no less so . what other hope have you ? " " i have none , sire , outside your service . " " why this silence , then ? why do you not give the assurance which i demand ? " " i can do it , sire . " " you can do it ! " " it be impossible . i should have no more peace in my mind , or respect for myself , if i know that for the sake of position or wealth i have give up the faith of my father . " " man , you be surely mad ! there be all that a man could covet upon one side , and what be there upon the other ? " " there be my honour . " " and be it , then , a dishonour to embrace my religion ? " " it would be a dishonour to me to embrace it for the sake of gain without believe in it . " " then believe it . " " alas , sire , a man can force himself to believe . belief be a thing which must come to him , not he to it . " " on my word , father , " say , glance with a bitter smile at his jesuit confessor , " i shall have to pick the cadet of the household from your seminary , since my officer have turn casuist and theologian . so , for the last time , you refuse to obey my request ? " " oh , -- " take a step forward with outstretch hand and tear in his eye . but the king check him with a gesture . " i desire no protestation , " say he . " i judge a man by his act . do you abjure or not ? " " i can , sire . " " you see , " say , turn again to the jesuit , " it will not be as easy as you think . " " this man be obstinate , it be true , but many other will be more yielding . " the king shake his head . " i would that i know what to do , " say he . " madame , i know that you , at least , will ever give me the good advice . you have hear all that have be say . what do you recommend ? " she keep her eye still fix upon her tapestry , but her voice be firm and clear as she answer : -- - " you have yourself say that you be the eldest son of the . if the eldest son desert her , then who will do her bidding ? and there be truth , too , in what the holy have say . you may imperil your own soul by condone this sin of heresy . it grow and flourish , and if it be not root out now , it may choke the truth as weed and brier choke the wheat . " " there be district in now , " say , " where a church be not to be see in a day 's journey , and where all the folk , from the noble to the peasant , be of the same accursed faith . so it be in the , where the people be as fierce and rugged as their own mountain . heaven guard the priest who have to bring them back from their error . " " whom should i send on so perilous a task ? " ask . the be down in a instant upon his knee with his gaunt hand outstretch . " send me , sire ! me ! " he cry . " i have never ask a favour of you , and never will again . but i be the man who could break this people . send me with your message to the people of the . " " help the people of the ! " mutter , as he look with mingle respect and loathing at the emaciate face and fiery eye of the fanatic . " very well , , " he add aloud ; " you shall go to the . " perhaps for an instant there come upon the stern priest some premonition of that dreadful morning when , as he crouch in a corner of ' his burning home , fifty dagger be to rasp against each other in his body . he sink his face in his hand , and a shudder pass over his gaunt frame . then he rise , and fold his arm , he resume his impassive attitude . take up the pen from the table , and draw the paper towards him . " i have the same counsel , then , from all of you , " say he , -- you , bishop ; from you , father ; from you , madame ; from you , ; and from you , . well , if ill come from it , may it not be visit upon me ! but what be this ? " have take a step forward with his hand outstretch . his ardent , impetuous nature have suddenly break down all the barrier of caution , and he seem for the instant to see that countless throng of man , woman , and child of his own faith , all unable to say a word for themselves , and all look to him as their champion and spokesman . he have think little of such matter when all be well , but now , when danger threaten , the deep side of his nature be move , and he feel how light a thing be life and fortune when weigh against a great abiding cause and principle . " do not sign it , sire , " he cry . " you will live to wish that your hand have wither ere it grasp that pen . i know it , sire . i be sure of it . consider all these helpless little child , the young girl , the old and the feeble . their creed be themselves . as well ask the leave to change the twig on which they grow . they could not change . at most you could but hope to turn them from honest folk into hypocrite . and why should you do it ? they honour you . they love you . they harm none . they be proud to serve in your army , to fight for you , to work for you , to build up the greatness of your kingdom . i implore you , sire , to think again before you sign an order which will bring misery and desolation to so many . " for a moment the king have hesitate as he listen to the short abrupt sentence in which the soldier plead for his fellow , but his face harden again as he remember how even his own personal entreaty have be unable to prevail with this young dandy of the court . " 's religion should be that of 's king , " say he , " and if my own guardsman thwart me in such a matter , i must find other who will be more faithful . that major 's commission in the must go to , . " " very good , sire . " " and 's commission may be transfer to . " " very good , sire . " " and i be to serve you no longer ? " " you be too dainty for my service . " 's arm fall listlessly to his side , and his head sink forward upon his breast . then , as he realise the ruin of all the hope of his life , and the cruel injustice with which he have be treat , he break into a cry of despair , and rush from the room with the hot tear of impotent anger run down his face . so , sob , gesticulate , with coat unbutton and hat awry , he burst into the stable where placid be smoke his pipe and watch with critical eye the groom of the horse . " what in thunder be the matter now ? " he ask , hold his pipe by the bowl , while the blue wreath curl up from his lip . " this sword , " cry the have no right to wear it ! i shall break it ! " " well , and i will break my knife too if it will hearten you up . " " and these , " cry , tug at his silver shoulder-strap , " they must go . " " ah , you draw ahead of me there , for i never have any . but come , friend , let me know the trouble , that i may see if it may not be mend . " " to ! to ! " shout the guardsman frantically . " if i be ruin , i may yet be in time to save them . the horse , quick ! " it be clear to the american that some sudden calamity have befall , so he aid his comrade and the groom to saddle and bridle . five minute later they be fly on their way , and in little more than an hour their steed , all reek and , be pull up outside the high house in the . spring from his saddle and rush upstairs , while follow in his own leisurely fashion . the old huguenot and his beautiful daughter be seat at one side of the great fireplace , her hand in his , and they spring up together , she to throw herself with a glad cry into the arm of her lover , and he to grasp the hand which his nephew hold out to him . at the other side of the fireplace , with a very long pipe in his mouth and a cup of wine upon a settle beside him , sit a man , with grizzled hair and beard , a fleshy red project nose , and two little gray eye , which twinkle out from under huge brindled brow . his long thin face be lace and seam with wrinkle , cross and everywhere , but fan out in hundred from the corner of his eye . it be set in an unchanging expression , and as it be of the same colour all over , as dark as the dark walnut , it might have be some quaint figure-head cut out of a coarse-grained wood . he be clad in a blue serge jacket , a pair of red breech smear at the knee with tar , clean gray worsted stocking , large steel buckle over his coarse square-toed shoe , and beside him , balance upon the top of a thick oaken cudgel , be a hat . his hair be gather up behind into a short stiff tail , and a seaman 's hanger , with a brass handle , be gird to his waist by a tarnished leather belt . have be too occupy to take notice of this singular individual , but give a shout of delight at the sight of him , and run forward to greet him . the other 's wooden face relax so far as to show two fang , and , without rise , he hold out a great red hand , of the size and shape of a moderate spade . " why , , " cry in , " who ever would have think of find you here ? , this be my old friend , under whose charge i come here . " " be apeak , lad , and the hatch down , " say the stranger , in the peculiar drawl voice which the have retain from their ancestor , the . " and when do you sail ? " " as soon as your foot be on her deck , if serve us with wind and tide . and how have all go with , ? " " right well . i have much to tell you of . " " i trust that you have hold yourself apart from all their popish devilry . " " yes , yes , . " " and have have no truck with the scarlet woman . " " no , no ; but what be it now ? " the grizzled hair be bristle with rage , and the little gray eye be gleam from under the heavy tuft . , follow their gaze , see that be seat with his arm round , while her head rest upon his shoulder . " ah , if i but know their , lingo ! see one ever such a sight ! , lad , what be the french for ' a shameless hussy ' ? " " , nay , . surely one may see such a sight , and think no harm of it , on our side of the water . " never , . in no godly country . " " tut ! i have see folk court in . " " ah , ! i say in no godly country . i can answer for or . of , or of at the furthest , there be no say what folk will do . very sure i be that in or or she would see the bridewell and he the stock for half as much . ah ! " he shake his head and bend his brow at the guilty couple . but they and their old relative be far too engross with their own affair to give a thought to the seaman . have tell his tale in a few short , bitter sentence , the injustice that have be do to him , his dismissal from the king 's service , and the ruin which have come upon the huguenot of . , as be the angel instinct of woman , think only of her lover and his misfortune as she listen to his story , but the old merchant totter to his foot when he hear of the revocation of the edict , and stand with shake limb , stare about him in bewilderment . " what be i to do ? " he cry . " what be i to do ? i be too old to begin my life again . " " never fear , uncle , " say heartily . " there be other land beyond . " " but not for me . no , no ; i be too old . , but hand be heavy upon servant . now be the vial open , and the carve work of the sanctuary throw down . ah , what shall i do , and whither shall i turn ? " he wring his hand in his perplexity . " what be amiss with him , then , ? " ask the seaman . " though i know nothing of what he say , yet i can see that he fly a distress signal . " " he and his must leave the country , . " " and why ? " " because they be protestant , and the king will not abide their creed . " be across the room in an instant , and have enclose the old merchant 's thin hand in his own great knotted fist . there be a brotherly sympathy in his strong grip and rugged face which hold up the other 's courage as no word could have do . " what be the french for ' the scarlet woman , ' ? " he ask , glance over his shoulder . " tell this man that we shall see him through . tell him that we have get a country where he will just fit in like a bung in a barrel . tell him that religion be free to all there , and not a papist near than or the of the penobscot . tell him that if he want to come , the be wait with her anchor apeak and her cargo aboard . tell him what you like , so long as you make him come . " " then we must come at once , " say , as he listen to the cordial message which be convey to his uncle . " the order will be out , and it may be too late . " " but my business ! " cry the merchant . " take what valuable you can , and leave the rest . well that than lose all , and liberty into the bargain . " and so at last it be arrange . that very night , within five minute of the closing of the gate , there pass out of a small party of five , three upon horseback , and two in a closed carriage which bear several weighty box upon the top . they be the first leave fly before the hurricane , the early of that great multitude who be within the next few month to stream along every road which lead from , find their journey 's end too often in galley , dungeon and torture chamber , and yet flood over the frontier in number sufficient to change the industry and modify the character of all the neighbour people . like the israelite of old , they have be drive from their home at the bidding of an angry king , who , even while he exile them , throw every difficulty in the way of their departure . like them , too , there be none of them who could hope to reach their promised land without grievous wandering , penniless , friendless , and destitute . what passage befall these pilgrim in their travel , what danger they meet , and overcome in the land of the swiss , on the , among the , in , in , in , and even in far-off , have still to be write . this one little group , however , whom we know , we may follow in their venturesome journey , and see the chance which befall them upon that great continent which have lie fallow for so long , sow only with the weed of humanity , but which be now at last about to quicken into such glorious life . thank to the early tidings which the guardsman have bring with him , his little party be now ahead of the news . as they pass through the village of in the early morning they catch a glimpse of a naked corpse upon a dunghill , and be tell by a grin watchman that it be that of a huguenot who have die impenitent , but that be a common enough occurrence already , and do not mean that there have be any change in the law . at all be quiet , and before evening have bring both them and such property as they have save aboard of his brigantine , the . it be but a little craft , some seventy ton burden , but at a time when so many be put out to sea in open boat , prefer the wrath of nature to that of the king , it be a refuge indeed . the same night the seaman draw up his anchor and begin to slowly make his way down the wind river . and very slow work it be . there be half a moon shine and a breeze from the east , but the stream writhe and twist and turn until sometimes they seem to be sail up rather than down . in the long reach they set the yard square and run , but often they have to lower their two boat and warp her painfully along , of , the mate , and six grave , , seaman with their broad palmetto hat , tug and strain at the oar . , , and even the old merchant have to take their spell ere morning , when the sailor be need aboard for the handling of the canvas . at last , however , with the early dawn the river broaden out and each bank trend away , leave a long estuary between . snuff the air and pace the deck briskly with a twinkle in his keen gray eye . the wind have fall away , but there be still enough to drive them slowly upon their course . " where be the gal ? " he ask . " she be in my cabin , " say . " i think that maybe she could manage there until we get across . " " where will you sleep yourself , then ? " " tut , a litter of spruce bough and a sheet of birch bark over me have be enough all these year . what would i ask well than this deck of soft white pine and my blanket ? " " very good . the old man and his nephew , him with the blue coat , can have the two empty bunk . but you must speak to that man , . i will have no philander aboard my ship , whisper or cuddle or any such foolishness . tell him that this ship be just a bit break off from , and he will have to put up with way until he get off her . they have be good enough for good man than him . you give me the french for ' no philander , ' and i will bring him up with a round turn when he drift . " " it be a pity we leave so quick or they might have be marry before we start . she be a good girl , , and he be a fine man , for all that their way be not the same as ours . they do n't seem to take life so hard as we , and maybe they get more pleasure out of it . " " i never hear tell that we be put here to get pleasure out of it , " say the old , shake his head . " the valley of the shadow of death do n't seem to me to be the kind o ' name one would give to a . it be a trial and a chasten , that be what it be , the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity . we be bad from the beginning , like a stream that run from a tamarack swamp , and we have enough to do to get ourselves to right without any fool 's talk about pleasure . " " it seem to me to be all mix up , " say . " like the fat and the lean in a bag of pemmican . look at that sun just push its edge over the tree , and see the pink flush on the cloud and the river like a rosy ribbon behind us . it be mighty pretty to our eye , and very pleasing to us , and it would n't be so to my mind if the creator have n't want it to be . many a time when i have lie in the wood in the fall and smoke my pipe , and feel how good the tobacco be , and how bright the yellow maple be , and the purple ash , and the red tupelo blaze among the , i have feel that the real fool 's talk be with the man who could doubt that all this be mean to make the world happy for us . " " you have be think too much in them wood , " say , gaze at him uneasily . " do n't let your sail be too great for your boat , lad , nor trust to your own wisdom . your father be from the , and you be raise from a stock that cast the dust of from their foot rather than bow down to . keep a grip on the word and do n't think beyond it . but what be the matter with the old man ? he do n't seem easy in his mind . " the old merchant have be lean over the bulwark , look back with a draw face and weary eye at the red curve track behind them which mark the path to . have come up now , with not a thought to spare upon the danger and trouble which lay in front of her as she chafe the old man 's thin cold hand , and whisper word of love and comfort into his ear . but they have come to the point where the gentle river begin for the first time to throb to the beat of the sea . the old man gaze forward with horror at the bowsprit as he see it rise slowly upwards into the air , and cling frantically at the rail as it seem to slip away from beneath him . " we be always in the hollow of 's hand , " he whisper , " but oh , , it be a dreadful thing to feel his finger move under us . " " come with me , uncle , " say , pass his arm under that of the old man . " it be long since you have rest . and you , , i pray that you will go and sleep , my poor darling , for it have be a weary journey . go now , to please me , and when you wake , both and your trouble will lie behind you . " when father and daughter have leave the deck , make his way aft again to where and the captain be stand . " i be glad to get them below , , " say he , " for i fear that we may have trouble yet . " " and how ? " " you see the white road which run by the southern bank of the river . twice within the last half-hour i have see horseman spur for dear life along it . where the spire and smoke be yonder be , and thither it be that these man go . i know not who could ride so madly at such an hour unless they be the messenger of the king . oh , see , there be a third one ! " on the white band which wind among the green meadow a black dot could be see which move along with great rapidity , vanish behind a clump of tree , and then reappear again , make for the distant city . draw out his glass and gaze at the rider . " ay , ay , " say he , as he snap it up again . " it be a soldier , sure enough . i can see the glint of the scabbard which he carry on his larboard side . i think we shall have more wind soon . with a breeze we can show our heel to anything in french water , but a galley or an armed boat would overhaul us now . " , who , though he could speak little english , have learn in to understand it pretty well , look anxiously at . " i fear that we shall bring trouble on this good captain , " say he , " and that the loss of his cargo and ship may be his reward for have befriend us . ask him whether he would not prefer to land us on the north bank . with our money we might make our way into the . " look at his passenger with eye which have lose something of their sternness . " young man , " say he , " i see that you can understand something of my talk . " nod . " i tell you then that i be a bad man to beat . any man that be ever shipmate with me would tell you as much . i just jam my helm and keep my course as long as will let me . see ? " again nod , though in truth the seaman 's metaphor leave him with but a very general sense of his meaning . " we be ' abreast of that there town , and in ten minute we shall know if there be any trouble wait for us . but i will tell you a story as we go that will show you what kind o ' man you have ship with . it be ten year ago that i speak of , when i be in the , brig , ' betwixt and , ' south with lumber and skin and 's , see , and north again with tobacco and molasses . one night , ' half a gale from the , we run on a reef two mile to the east of , and down we go with a hole in our bottom like as if she have be on the steeple o ' one o ' them church . well , in the morning there i be washin ' about , nigh out of sight of land , ' on to half the foreyard , without a sign either of my mate or of wreckage . i be n't so cold , for it be early fall , and i could get three part of my body on to the spar , but i be hungry and thirsty and bruise , so i just take in two hole of my , and put up a hymn , and have a look round for what i could see . well , i see more than i care for . within five pace of me there be a great fish , as long pretty nigh as the spar that i be ' . it be a mighty pleasant thing to have your leg in the water and a beast like that all ready for a nibble at your toe . " ! " cry the french soldier . " and he have not eat you ? " 's little eye twinkle at the reminiscence . " i eat him , " say he . " what ! " cry . " it be a mortal fact . i have a jack-knife in my pocket , same as this one , and i kick my leg to keep the brute off , and i whittle away at the spar until i have get a good jagged bit off , sharp at each end , same as a nigger tell me once down way . then i wait for him , and stop kick , so he come at me like a hawk on a . when he turn up his belly i jam my leave hand with the wood right into his great ' mouth , and i let him have it with my knife between the gill . he try to break away then , but i hold on , see , though he take me so deep i think i will never come up again . i be nigh go when we get to the surface , but he be ' with the white up , and twenty hole in his shirt front . then i get back to my spar , for we have go a long fifty fathom under water , and when i reach it i faint dead away . " " and then ? " " well , when i come to , it be calm , and there be the dead shark ' beside me . i paddle my spar over to him and i get loose a few yard of halliard that be ' from one end of it . i make a round his tail , see , and get the end of it sling over the spar and fasten , so as i could n't lose him . then i set to work and i eat him in a week right up to his back fin , and i drink the rain that fall on my coat , and when i be pick up by the of , i be that fat that i could scarce climb aboard . that be what mean , my lad , when he say that he be a man to beat . " whilst the seaman have be detail his reminiscence , his eye have keep wander from the cloud to the flap sail and back . such wind as there be come in little short puff , and the canvas either draw full or be absolutely slack . the fleecy shred of cloud above , however , travel swiftly across the blue sky . it be on these that the captain fix his gaze , and he watch them like a man who be work out a problem in his mind . they be abreast of now , and about half a mile out from it . several sloop and brig be lie there in a cluster , and a whole fleet of be tack slowly in . yet all be quiet on the curve quay and on the half-moon fort over which float the white flag with the golden fleur-de-lis . the port lie on their quarter now and they be draw away more quickly as the breeze freshen . glance back have almost make up his mind that their fear be quite groundless when they be bring back in an instant and more urgently than ever . round the corner of the mole a great dark boat have dash into view , ringed round with foam from her fly prow , and from the ten pair of oar which swing from either side of her . a dainty white ensign droop over her stern , and in her bow the sun 's light be catch by a heavy brass carronade . she be pack with man , and the gleam which twinkle every now and again from amongst them tell that they be arm to the tooth . the captain bring his glass to bear upon them and whistle . then he glance up at the cloud once more . " thirty man , " say he , " and they go three pace to our two . you , sir , take your blue coat off this deck or you will bring trouble upon us . the will look after his own if they will only keep from foolishness . get these hatch off , . so ! where be and ? let them stand by to clap them on again when i whistle . starboard ! starboard ! keep her as full as she will draw . now , , and you , , come here until i have a word with you . " the three stand in consultation upon the poop , glance back at their pursuer . there could be no doubt that the wind be freshen ; it blow briskly in their face as they look back , but it be not steady yet , and the boat be rapidly overhaul them . already they could see the face of the marine who sit in the stern , and the gleam of the lighted linstock which the gunner hold in his hand . ! " cry an officer in excellent . " lay her to or we fire " " who be you , and what do you want ? " shout , in a voice that might have be hear from the bank . " we come in the king 's name , and we want a party of huguenot from who come on board of your vessel at . " " brace back the foreyard and lay her to , " shout the captain . " drop a ladder over the side there and look smart ! so ! now we be ready for them . " the yard be swing round and the vessel lie quietly rise and fall on the wave . the boat dash alongside , her brass cannon train upon the brigantine , and her squad of marine with their finger upon their trigger ready to open fire . they grin and shrug their shoulder when they see that their sole opponent be three unarmed man upon the poop . the officer , a young active fellow with a bristle moustache , like the whisker of a cat , be on deck in an instant with his draw sword in his hand . " come up , two of you ! " he cry . " you stand here at the head of the ladder , sergeant . throw up a rope and you can fix it to this stanchion . keep awake down there and be all ready to fire ! you come with me , . who be captain of this ship ? " " i be , sir , " say submissively . " you have three huguenot aboard ? " " tut ! tut ! huguenot , be they ? i think they be very anxious to get away , but as long as they pay their passage it be no business of mine . an old man , his daughter , and a young fellow about your age in some sort of livery . " " in uniform , sir ! the uniform of the king 's guard . those be the folk i have come for . " " and you wish to take them back ? " " most certainly . " " poor folk ! i be sorry for them . " " and so be i , but order be order and must be do . " " quite so . well , the old man be in his bunk asleep . the maid be in a cabin below . and the other be sleep down the hold there where we have to put him , for there be no room elsewhere . " " sleeping , you say ? we have well surprise him . " " but think you that you dare do it alone ! he have no arm , it be true , but he be a young fellow . will you not have twenty man up from the boat ? " some such thought have pass through the officer 's head , but the captain 's remark put him upon his mettle . " come with me , corporal , " say he . " down this ladder , you say ? " " yes , down the ladder and straight on . he lie between those two cloth bale . " look up with a smile play about the corner of his grim mouth . the wind be whistle now in the rigging , and the stays of the mast be hum like two harp string . lounge beside the french sergeant who guard the end of the rope ladder , while , the mate , stand with a bucket of water in his hand exchange remark in very bad french with the crew of the boat beneath him . the officer make his way slowly down the ladder which lead into the hold , and the corporal follow him , and have his chest level with the deck when the other have reach the bottom . it may have be something in 's face , or it may have be the gloom around him which startle the young frenchman , but a sudden suspicion flash into his mind . " up again , corporal ! " he shout , " i think that you be well at the top . " " and i think that you be well down below , my friend , " say the , who gather the officer 's meaning from his gesture . put the sole of his boot against the man 's chest he give a shove which send both him and the ladder crash down on to the officer beneath him . as he do so he blow his whistle , and in a moment the hatch be back in its place and clamp down on each side with iron bar . the sergeant have swing round at the sound of the crash , but , who have wait for the movement , throw his arm about him and hurl him overboard into the sea . at the same instant the connect rope be sever , the foreyard creak back into position again , and the bucketful of salt water souse down over the gunner and his gun , put out his linstock and wet his priming . a shower of ball from the marine pipe through the air or rap up against the plank , but the boat be toss and jerk in the short choppy wave and to aim be impossible . in vain the man tug and strain at their oar while the gunner work like a maniac to his linstock and to replace his priming . the boat have lose its weigh , while the brigantine be fly along now with every sail bulge and swell to . crack ! go the carronade at last , and five little slit in the mainsail show that her charge of grape have flow high . her second shot leave no trace behind it , and at the third she be at the limit of her range . half an hour afterwards a little dark dot upon the horizon with a golden speck at one end of it be all that could be see of the guard-boat . wide and wide grow the low-lying shore , broad and broad be the vast spread of blue water ahead , the smoke of lie like a little cloud upon the northern horizon , and pace his deck with his face as grim as ever , but with a dancing light in his gray eye . " i know that the would look after his own , " say he complacently . " we have get her beak straight now , and there be not as much as a dab of mud betwixt this and the three hill of . you have have too much of these french wine of late , , lad . come down and try a real brewing with a double stroke of malt in the mash tub . " for two day the lie becalmed close to the , with the breton coast extend along the whole of the southern horizon . on the third morning , however , come a sharp breeze , and they draw rapidly away from land , until it be but a vague dim line which blend with the cloud bank . out there on the wide free ocean , with the wind on their cheek and the salt spray upon their lip , these hunted folk might well throw off their sorrow and believe that they have leave for ever behind them all token of those strenuous man whose earnest piety have do more harm than frivolity and wickedness could have accomplish . and yet even now they could not shake off their trace , for the sin of the cottage be bound by the cottage door , but that of the palace spread its evil over land and sea . " i be frighten about my father , , " say , as they stand together by the shroud and look back at the dim cloud upon the horizon which mark the position of that which they be never to see again . " but he be out of danger now . " " out of danger from cruel law , but i fear that he will never see the promised land . " " what do you mean , ? my uncle be hale and hearty . " " ah , , his very be fasten in the , and when they be tear his life be tear also . and his business , they be the world to him . " " but he will accustom himself to this new life . " " if it only could be so ! but i fear , i fear , that he be over old for such a change . he say not a word of complaint . but i read upon his face that he be strike to the heart . for hour together he will gaze back at , with the tear run silently down his cheek . and his hair have turn from gray to white within the week . " also have notice that the gaunt old huguenot have grow gaunt , that the line upon his stern face be deep , and that his head fall forward upon his breast as he walk . he be about , however , to suggest that the voyage might restore the merchant 's health , when give a cry of surprise and point out over the port quarter . so beautiful be she at the instant with her raven hair blow back by the wind , a glow of colour strike into her pale cheek by the drive spray , her lip part in her excitement , and one white hand shade her eye , that he stand beside her with all his thought bend upon her grace and her sweetness . " look ! " she cry . " there be something float upon the sea . i see it upon the crest of a wave . " he look in the direction in which she point , but at first he see nothing . the wind be still behind them , and a brisk sea be run of a deep rich green colour , with long creamy curling cap to the large wave . the breeze would catch these from time to time , and then there would be a sharp spatter upon the deck , with a salt smack upon the lip , and a in the eye . suddenly as he gaze , however , something black be tilt up upon the sharp summit of one of the sea , and swoop out of view again upon the further side . it be so far from him that he could make nothing of it , but sharp eye than his have catch a glance of it . have see the girl point and observe what it be which have attract her attention . " , " cry he , " there be a boat on the starboard quarter . " the seaman whip up his glass and steady it upon the bulwark . " ay , it be a boat , " say he , " but an empty one . maybe it have be wash off from some ship , or go adrift from shore . put her hard down , , for it just so happen that i be in need of a boat at present . " half a minute later the have swing round and be run swiftly down towards the black spot which still bob and dance upon the wave . as they near her they could see that something be project over her side . " it be a man 's head ! " cry . but 's grim face grow grim . " it be a man 's foot , " say he . " i think that you have well take the gal below to the cabin . " amid a solemn hush they run alongside this lonely craft which hang out so sinister a signal . within ten yard of her the foreyard be haul aback and they gaze down upon her terrible crew . she be a little cockle-shell , very broad for her length and so flat in the bottom that she have be mean evidently for river or lake work . huddle together beneath the seat be three folk , a man in the dress of a respectable artisan , a woman of the same class , and a little child about a year old . the boat be half full of water and the woman and child be stretch with their face downwards , the fair curl of the infant and the dark lock of the mother wash to and fro like upon the surface . the man lie with a face , his chin cock up towards the sky , his eye turn upwards to the white , and his mouth wide open show a leathern crinkle tongue like a rot leaf . in the bow , all huddle in a heap , and with a single paddle still grasp in his hand , there crouch a very small man clad in black , an open book lie across his face , and one stiff leg jut upwards with the heel of the foot rest between the rowlock . so this strange company swoop and toss upon the long green atlantic roller . a boat have be lower by the , and the unfortunate be soon convey upon deck . no particle of either food or drink be to be find , nor anything save the single paddle and the open bible which lie across the small man 's face . man , woman , and child have all be dead a day at the least , and so with the short prayer use upon the sea they be bury from the vessel 's side . the small man have at first seem also to be lifeless , but have detect some slight flutter of his heart , and the faint haze be leave upon the watch glass which be hold before his mouth . wrap in a dry blanket he be lay beside the mast , and the mate force a few drop of rum every few minute between his lip until the little spark of life which still linger in him might be fan to a flame . meanwhile have order up the two prisoner whom he have entrap at . very foolish they look as they stand blink and wink in the daylight from which they have be so long cut off . " very sorry , captain , " say the seaman , " but either you have to come with us , see , or we have to stay with you . they be wait for me over at , and in truth i really could n't tarry . " the french soldier shrug his shoulder and look around him with a lengthen face . he and his corporal be limp with sea-sickness , and as miserable as a frenchman be when first he find that have vanish from his view . " which would you prefer , to go on with us to , or go back to ? " " back to , if i can find my way . oh , i must get to again if only to have a word with that fool of a gunner . " " well , we empty a bucket of water over his linstock and priming , see , so maybe he do all he could . but there be , where that thickening be over yonder . " " i see it ! i see it ! ah , if my foot be only upon it once more . " " there be a boat beside us , and you may take it . " " my , what happiness ! corporal , the boat ! let us push off at once . " " but you need a few thing first . good , who ever hear of a man push off like that ! , just sling a keg of water and a barrel of meat and of biscuit into this boat . , bring two oar aft . it be a long pull with the wind in your tooth , but you will be there by night , and the weather be set fair . " the two frenchman be soon provide with all that they be likely to require , and push off with a wave of hat and a shouting of voyage . the foreyard be swing round again and the turn her bowsprit for the west . for hour a glimpse could be catch of the boat , dwindle away on the , until at last it vanish into the haze , and with it vanish the very last link which connect them with the great world which they be leave behind them . but whilst these thing have be do , the senseless man beneath the mast have twitch his eyelid , have draw a little gasp breath , and then finally have open his eye . his skin be like gray parchment draw tightly over his bone , and the limb which thrust out from his clothes be those of a sickly child . yet , weak as he be , the large black eye with which he look about him be full of dignity and power . have come upon deck , and at the sight of the man and of his dress he have run forward , and have raise his head reverently and rest it in his own arm . " he be one of the faithful , " he cry , " he be one of our pastor . ah , now indeed a blessing will be upon our journey ! " but the man smile gently and shake his head . " i fear that i may not come this journey with you , " say he , " for the have call me upon a further journey of my own . i have have my summons and i be ready . i be indeed the pastor of the temple at , and when we hear the order of the wicked king , i and two of the faithful with their little one put forth in the hope that we might come to . but on the first day there come a wave which sweep away one of our oar and all that be in the boat , our bread , our keg , and we be leave with no hope save in . and then he begin to call us to one at a time , first the child , and then the woman , and then the man , until i only be leave , though i feel that my own time be not long . but since be also of the faithful , may i not serve you in any way before i go ? " the merchant shake his head , and then suddenly a thought flash upon him , and he run with joy upon his face and whisper eagerly to . laugh , and stride across to the captain . " it be time , " say grimly . then the whisperer go to . he spring in the air and his eye shine with delight . and then they go down to in her cabin , and she start and blush , and turn her sweet face away , and pat her hair with her hand as woman will when a sudden call be make upon her . and so , since haste be needful , and since even there upon the lonely sea there be one come who might at any moment snap their purpose , they find themselves in a few minute , this gallant man and this pure woman , kneel hand in hand before the die pastor , who raise his thin arm feebly in benediction as he mutter the word which should make them forever one . have often picture her wedding to herself , as what young girl have not ? often in her dream she have kneel before the altar with in the temple of the . or sometimes her fancy have take her to some of those small church in the province , those little refuge where a handful of believer gather together , and it be there that her thought have place the crown act of a woman 's life . but when have she think of such a marriage as this , with the white deck sway beneath them , the rope hum above , their only chorister the gull which scream around them , and their wedding hymn the anthem which be strike from the wave by the wind ? and when could she forget the scene ? the yellow mast and the belly sail , the gray draw face and the crack lip of the castaway , her father 's gaunt earnest feature as he kneel to support the die minister , in his blue coat , already fade and . with his wooden face turn towards the cloud , and with his hand in his pocket and a quiet twinkle in his blue eye ! then behind all the lanky mate and the little group of seaman with their palmetto hat and their serious face ! and so it be do amid kindly word in a harsh foreign tongue , and the shake of rude hand harden by the rope and the oar . and his wife lean together by the shroud when all be over and watch the black side as it rise and fall , and the green water which race past them . " it be all so strange and so new , " she say . " our future seem as vague and dark as yonder cloud-bank which gather in front of us . " " if it rest with me , " he answer , " your future will be as merry and bright as the sunlight that glint on the crest of these wave . the country that drive us forth lie far behind us , but out there be another and a fair country , and every breath of wind waft us near to it . await us there , and we bear with us youth and love , and what could man or woman ask for more ? " so they stand and talk while the shadow deepen into twilight and the first faint gleam of the star break out in the darken heaven above them . but ere those star have wane again one more toiler have find rest aboard the , and the scattered flock from have find their little pastor once more . for three week the wind keep at east or , always at a brisk breeze and freshen sometimes into half a gale . the speed merrily upon her way with every sail drawing , alow and aloft , so that by the end of the third week and be reckon out the hour before they would look upon their native land once more . to the old seaman who be use to meeting and to part it be a small matter , but , who have never be away before , be on fire with impatience , and would sit smoking for hour with his leg astride the shank of the bowsprit , stare ahead at the skyline , in the hope that his friend 's reckoning have be wrong , and that at any moment he might see the beloved coast line loom up in front of him . " it be no use , lad , " say , lay his great red hand upon his shoulder . " they that go down to the sea in ship need a power of patience , and there be no good ' your heart out for what you ca n't get . " " there be a feel of home about the air , though , " answer . " it seem to whistle through your tooth with a bite to it that i never feel over yonder . ah , it will take three month of the mohawk before i feel myself to right . " " well , " say his friend , thrust a plug of tobacco into the corner of his cheek , " i have be on the sea since i have hair to my face , mostly in the coast trade , see , but over the water as well , as far as those navigation law would let me . except the two year that i come ashore for the business , when every man that could carry a gun be need on the border , i have never be three cast of a biscuit from salt water , and i tell you that i never know a good crossing than the one we have just make . " " ay , we have come along like a buck before a forest fire . but it be strange to me how you find your way so clearly out here with never track nor trail to guide you . it would puzzle me , , to find , to say nought of the of . " " i be somewhat too far to the north , . we have be on or about the fiftieth since we sight . we should make land , by my ' . " " ah , ! and what will it be ? ? ? ? " " , lad , we be in the latitude of the , and be more like to see the coast . then with this wind a day should carry us south , or two at the most . a few more such voyage and i shall buy myself a fair brick house in of , where i can look down on the bay , or on the or the mystic , and see the ship ' and ' . so i would end my life in peace and quiet . " all day , in spite of his friend 's assurance , strain his eye in the fruitless search for land , and when at last the darkness fall he go below and lay out his fringe hunting tunic , his leather gaiter , and his cap , which be very much more to his taste than the broadcloth coat in which the dutch mercer of have clad him . have also put on the dark coat of civil life , and he and be busy prepare all thing for the old man , who have fall so weak that there be little which he could do for himself . a fiddle be scream in the forecastle , and half the night through hoarse burst of homely song mingle with the dash of the wave and the whistle of the wind , as the man in their own grave and stolid fashion make merry over their . the mate 's watch that night be from twelve to four , and the moon be shine brightly for the first hour of it . in the early morning , however , it cloud over , and the plunge into one of those dim clammy mist which lie on all that tract of ocean . so thick be it that from the poop one could just make out the loom of the foresail , but could see nothing of the sail or the jib . the wind be with a very keen edge to it , and the dainty brigantine lie over , scud along with her lee rail within hand 's touch of the water . it have suddenly turn very cold that the mate stamp up and down the poop , and his four seaman shiver together under the shelter of the bulwark . and then in a moment one of them be up , thrust with his forefinger into the air and scream , while a huge white wall spring out of the darkness at the very end of the bowsprit , and the ship strike with a force which snap her two mast like dry reed in a wind , and change her in an instant to a crushed and shapeless heap of spar and wreckage . the mate have shoot the length of the poop at the shock , and have narrowly escape from the fall mast , while of his four man two have be hurl through the huge gap which yawn in the bow , while a third have dash his head to piece against the stock of the anchor . stagger forwards to find the whole front part of the vessel drive inwards , and a single seaman sit daze amid splinter spar , flap sail , and writhe , lash cordage . it be still as dark as pitch , and save the white crest of a leap wave nothing be to be see beyond the side of the vessel . the mate be peer round him in despair at the ruin which have come so suddenly upon them when he find at his elbow , half clad , but as wooden and as serene as ever . " an iceberg , " say he , sniff at the chill air . " do you not smell it , friend ? " " truly i find it cold , , but i set it down to the mist . " " there be a mist ever set around them , though the in his wisdom know good why , for it be a sore trial to poor sailor man . she make water fast , . she be down by the bow already . " the other watch have swarm upon deck and one of them be measure the well . " there be three foot of water , " he cry , " and the pump suck dry yesterday at sundown . " " and to the pump ! " cry the captain . " , clear away the and let us see if we may set her right , though i fear that she be past mending . " " the have stove two plank , " cry a seaman . " the , then ? " " she be in three piece . " the mate tear his hair , but smile like a man who be gently tickle by some coincidence . " where be ? " " here , . what can i do ? " " and i ? " ask eagerly . and her father have be wrap in mantle and place for shelter in the lee of the round house . " tell him he can take his spell at the pump , " say the to . " and you , , you be a handy man with a tool . get into yonder with a lantern and see if you can patch her up . " for half an hour hammer and trim and caulk , while the sharp measured clank of the pump sound above the dash of the sea . slowly , very slowly , the bow of the brigantine be settle down , and her stern cock up . " you have not much time , , lad , " say the captain quietly . " she will float now , though she be not quite . " " very good . lower away ! keep up the pump in there ! , see that provision and water be ready , as much as she will hold . come with me , . " the seaman and the captain swing themselves down into the toss boat , the latter with a lantern strap to his waist . together they make their way until they be under her mangle bow . the captain shake his head when he see the extent of the damage . " cut away the foresail and pass it over , " say he . and cut away the lashing with their knife and lower the corner of the sail . and the seaman seize it , and drag it across the mouth of the huge gape leak . as he stoop to do it , however , the ship heave up upon a swell , and the captain see in the yellow light of his lantern sinuous black crack which radiate away backwards from the central hole . " how much in the well ? " he ask . " five and a half foot . " " then the ship be lose . i could put my finger between her plank as far as i can see back . keep the pump go there ! have you the food and water , ? " " here , sir . " " lower them over the bow . this boat can live more than an hour or two . can you see anything of the berg ? " " the fog be lift on the starboard quarter , " cry one of the man . " yes , there be the berg , quarter of a mile to leeward ! " the mist have thin away suddenly , and the moon glimmer through once more upon the great lonely sea and the stricken ship . there , like a huge sail , be the monster piece of ice upon which they have shatter themselves , rock slowly to and fro with the wash of the wave . " you must make for her , " say . " there be no other chance . lower the gal over the bow ! well , then , her father first , if she like it well . tell them to sit still , , and that the will bear us up if we keep clear of foolishness . so ! you be a brave lass for all your niminy-piminy lingo . now the keg and the barrel , and all the wrap and cloak you can find . now the other man , the frenchman . ay , ay , passenger first , and you have get to come . now , ! now the seaman , and you last , friend . " it be well that they have not very far to go , for the boat be weigh down almost to the edge , and it take the bale of two man to keep in check the water which leak in between the shattered plank . when all be safely in their place . swing himself aboard again , which be but too easy now that every minute bring the bow near to the water . he come back with a bundle of clothing which he throw into the boat . " push off ! " he cry . " jump in , then . " " go down with his ship , " say he quietly . " , it be not my way to give my order more than once . push off , i say ! " the mate thrust her out with a boat-hook . and give a cry of dismay , but the stolid englander settle down to their oar and pull off for the iceberg . " ! ! will you suffer it ? " cry the guardsman in . " my honour will not permit me to leave him thus . i should feel it a stain for ever . " " , you would not leave him ! go on board and force him to come . " " the man be not live who could force him to do what he have no mind for . " " he may change his purpose . " " he never change his purpose . " " but you can leave him , man ! you must at least lie by and pick him up . " " the boat leak like a sieve , " say the mate . " i will take her to the berg , leave you all there , if we can find footing , and go back for the captain . put your heart into it , my lad , for the sooner we be there the sooner we shall get back . " but they have not take fifty stroke before give a sudden scream . " ! " she cry , " the ship be go down ! " she have settle low and low in the water , and suddenly with a sound of rend plank she thrust down her bow like a diving , her stern fly up into the air , and with a long sucking noise she shoot down swift and swift until the leap wave close over her high poop lantern . with one impulse the boat sweep round again and make backwards as fast as willing arm could pull it . but all be quiet at the scene of the disaster . not even a fragment of wreckage be leave upon the surface to show where the have find her last harbour . for a long quarter of an hour they pull round and round in the moonlight , but not a glimpse could they see of the seaman , and at last , when in spite of the baler the water be wash round their ankle , they put her head about once more , and make their way in silence and with heavy heart to their dreary island of refuge . desolate as it be , it be their only hope now , for the leak be increase and it be evident that the boat could not be keep afloat long . as they draw near they see with dismay that the side which face them be a solid wall of ice sixty foot high without a flaw or crevice in its whole extent . the berg be a large one , fifty pace at least each way , and there be a hope that the other side might be more favourable . bale hard , they paddle round the corner , but only to find themselves face by another gloomy . again they go round , and again they find that the berg increase rather than diminish in height . there remain only one other side , and they know as they row round to it that their life hang upon the result , for the boat be almost settle down beneath them . they shoot out from the shadow into the full moonlight and look upon a sight which none of them would forget until their die day . the cliff which face them be as precipitous as any of the other , and it glimmer and sparkle all over where the silver light fall upon the thousand facet of ice . right in the centre , however , on a level with the water 's edge , there be what appear to be a huge hollowed-out cave which mark the spot where the have , in shatter herself , dislodge a huge boulder , and so amid her own ruin prepare a refuge for those who have trust themselves to her . this cavern be of the rich emerald green , light and clear at the edge , but tone away into the deep purple and blue at the back . but it be not the beauty of this grotto , nor be it the assurance of rescue which bring a cry of joy and of wonder from every lip , but it be that , seat upon an ice boulder and placidly smoke a long corn-cob pipe , there be perch in front of them no less a person than of . for a moment the castaway could almost have believe that it be his wraith , be wraith ever see in so homely an attitude , but the tone of his voice very soon show that it be indeed he , and in no very christian temper either . " , " say he , " when i tell you to row for an iceberg i mean you to row right away there , see , and not to go philander about over the ocean . it be not your fault that i be not freeze , and so i would have be if i have n't some dry tobacco and my tinder-box to keep myself warm . " without stop to answer his commander 's reproach , the mate head for the ledge , which have be cut into a slope by the bow of the brigantine , so that the boat be run up easily on to the ice . seize his dry clothes and vanish into the back of the cave , to return presently warm in body , and more contented in mind . the have be turn upside down for a seat , the grating and thwart take out and cover with wrap to make a couch for the lady , and the head knock out of the keg of biscuit . " we be frighten for you , , " say . " i have a heavy heart this night when i think that i should never see you more . " " tut , , you should have know me well . " " but how come you here , captain ? " ask . " i think that maybe you have be take down by the suck of the ship . " " and so i be . it be the third ship in which i have go down , but they have never keep me down yet . i go deep than when the sink , but not so deep as in the . when i come up i swim to the berg , find this nook , and crawl in . glad i be to see you , for i fear that you have founder . " " we put back to pick you up and we pass you in the darkness . and what should we do now ? " " rig up that and make quarter for the gal . then get our supper and such rest as we can , for there be nothing to be do , and there may be much in the morning . " be arouse in the morning by a hand upon his shoulder , and spring to his foot , find stand beside him . the survivor of the crew be group about the upturn boat , slumber heavily after their labour of the night . the red rim of the sun have just push itself above the water-line , and sky and sea be one blaze of scarlet and orange from the dazzling gold of the horizon to the light pink at the zenith . the first ray flash directly into their cave , sparkle and glimmer upon the ice crystal and tinge the whole grotto with a rich warm light . never be a fairy 's palace more lovely than this floating refuge which have provide for them . but neither the nor the frenchman have time now to give a thought to the novelty and beauty of their situation . the latter 's face be grave , and his friend read danger in his eye . " what be it , then ? " " the berg . it be come to piece . " " tut , man , it be as solid as an island . " " i have be watch it . you see that crack which extend backwards from the end of our grotto . two hour ago i could scarce put my hand into it . now i can slip through it with ease . i tell you that she be split across . " walk to the end of the recess and find , as his friend have say , that a green sinuous crack extend away backwards into the iceberg , cause either by the toss of the wave , or by the terrific impact of their vessel . he rouse and point out the danger to him . " well , if she spring a leak we be go , " say he . " she have be thaw pretty fast as it be . " they could see now that what have seem in the moonlight to be smooth wall of ice be really furrow and wrinkle like an old man 's face by the stream of melt water which be continually run down them . the whole huge mass be brittle and honeycomb and rotten . already they could hear all round them the ominous drip , drip , and the splash and tinkle of the little rivulet as they fall into the ocean . " ! " cry , " what be that ? " " what then ? " " do you hear nothing ? " " no. " " i could have swear that i hear a voice . " " impossible . we be all here . " " it must have be my fancy then . " walk to the seaward face of the cave and sweep the ocean with his eye . the wind have quite fall away now , and the sea stretch away to the eastward , smooth and unbroken save for a single great black spar which float near the spot where the have founder . " we should lie in the track of some ship , " say the captain thoughtfully . " there be the codder and the . we be over far south for them , i reckon . but we ca n't be two hundred mile from in , and we be in the line of the trade . if i have three white mountain pine , , and a hundred yard of stout canvas i will get up on the top of this thing , see , and i will rig such a jury-mast as would send her hum into . then i will break her up and sell her for what she be worth , and turn a few piece over the business . but she be a heavy old craft , and that be a fact , though even now she might do a knot or two an hour if she have a hurricane behind her . but what be it , ? " the young hunter be stand with his ear slant , his head bent forward , and his eye glance sideways like a man who listen intently . he be about to answer when give a cry and point to the back of the cave . " look at the crack now . " it have widen by a foot since they have notice it last , until it be now no longer a crack . it be a pass . " let us go through , " say the captain . " it can but come out on the other side . " " then let us see the other side . " he lead the way and the other two follow him . it be very dark as they advance , with high drip ice wall on either side and one little zigzag slit of blue sky above their head . trip and grope their way , they stumble along until suddenly the passage grow wide and open out into a large square of flat ice . the berg be level in the centre and slope upwards from that point to the high cliff which bound it on each side . in three direction this slope be very steep , but in one it slant up quite gradually , and the constant thaw have groove the surface with a thousand irregularity by which an active man could ascend . with one impulse they begin all three to clamber up until a minute later they be stand not far from the edge of the summit , seventy foot above the sea , with a view which take in a good fifty mile of water . in all that fifty mile there be no sign of life , nothing but the endless glint of the sun upon the wave . whistle . " we be out of luck , " say he . look about him with startle eye . " i can understand it , " say he . " i could have the eternal , listen to that ! " the clear call of a military bugle ring out in the morning air . with a cry of amazement they all three crane forward and peer over the edge . a large ship be lie under the very shadow of the iceberg . they look straight down upon her snow-white deck , fringe with shine brass cannon , and dot with seaman . a little clump of soldier stand upon the poop go through the manual exercise , and it be from them that the call have come which have sound so unexpectedly in the ear of the castaway . stand back from the edge , they have not only look over the of this welcome neighbour , but they have themselves be invisible from her deck . now the discovery be mutual , as be show by a chorus of shout and cry from beneath them . but the three do not wait an instant . slide and scramble down the wet , slippery incline , they rush shout through the crack and into the cave where their comrade have just be startle by the while in the middle of their cheerless breakfast . a few hurried word and the leaky have be launch , their possession have be bundle in , and they be afloat once more . pull round a promontory of the berg , they find themselves under the stern of a fine corvette , the side of which be line with friendly face , while from the peak there droop a huge white banner mottle over with the golden lily of . in a very few minute their boat have be haul up and they find themselves on board the man-of-war , convey , the new governor-general of , to take over his duty . a singular colony it be of which the shipwreck party find themselves now to be member . the have leave three week before with four small consort convey five hundred soldier to help the struggle colony on the . the squadron have become separated , however , and the governor be pursue his way alone in the hope of pick up the other in the river . aboard he have a company of the regiment of , the staff of his own household , , the new of , with several of his attendant , three friar , and five jesuit bind for the fatal iroquois mission , half-a-dozen lady on their way out to join their husband , two nun , ten or twelve gallant whom love of adventure and the hope of better their fortune have draw across the sea , and lastly some twenty peasant maiden of who be secure of find husband wait for them upon the beach , if only for the sake of the sheet , the pot , the tin plate and the kettle which the king would provide for each of his humble ward . to add a handful of independent , a of , and three huguenot to such a gathering , be indeed to bring and together . and yet all aboard be so busy with their own concern that the castaway be leave very much to themselves . thirty of the soldier be down with fever and scurvy , and both priest and nun be fully take up in nurse them . , the governor , a dragoon , walk the deck all day read the of , and sit up half the night with map and chart lay out before him , plan out the destruction of the who be ravage his dominions . the gallant and the lady flirt , the maiden of make eye at the soldier of , and the bishop read his office and lecture his clergy . use to stand all day glare at the good man as he pace the deck with his missal in his hand , and mutter about the " abomination of desolation , " but his little way be put down to his exposure upon the iceberg , and to the fix idea in the french mind that man of the anglo-saxon stock be not to be hold accountable for their action . there be peace between and at present , though feeling run high between and , the french believe , and with some justice , that the english colonist be whooping on the demon who attack them . and his man be therefore receive hospitably on board , though the ship be so crowd that they have to sleep wherever they could find cover and space for their body . the , too , have be treat in an even more kindly fashion , the weak old man and the beauty of his daughter arouse the interest of the governor himself . have , during the voyage , exchange his uniform for a plain sombre suit , so that , except for his military bearing , there be nothing to show that he be a fugitive from the army . be now so weak that he be past the answering of question , his daughter be forever at his side , and the soldier be diplomatist enough , after a training at , to say much without say anything , and so their secret be still preserve . have know what it be to be a huguenot in before the law be alter . he have no wish to try it after . on the day after the rescue they sight in the south , and soon run swiftly before an easterly wind , see the loom of the east end of . then they sail up the mighty river , though from the bank upon either side be hardly to be see . as the shore narrow in , they see the wild gorge of the saguenay river upon the right , with the smoke from the little fishing and trading station of stream up above the pine tree . naked with their face daub with red clay , and , clustered round the ship in their canoe with fruit and vegetable from the land , which bring fresh life to the soldier . thence the ship tack on up the river past , the of the and the of with its broad valley and wooded mountain all in a blaze with their beautiful autumn dress , their scarlet , their purple , and their gold , from the maple , the ash , the young oak , and the sapling of the birch . , lean on the bulwark , stare with longing eye at these vast expanse of virgin woodland , hardly traverse save by an occasional wander savage or hardy . then the bold outline of loom up in front of them ; they pass the rich placid meadow of 's seigneury of , and , skirt the settlement of the of , they see the broad pool stretch out in front of them , the fall of , the high palisade of , the cluster of vessel , and upon the right that wonderful rock with its diadem of tower and its township huddle round its base , the centre and stronghold of french power in . thunder from the bastion above , and be echo back by the warship , while ensign dip , hat wave , and a swarm of boat and canoe shoot out to welcome the new governor , and to convey the soldier and passenger to shore . the old merchant have pine away since he have leave french soil , like a plant which have be pluck from its root . the shock of the shipwreck and the night spend in their bleak refuge upon the iceberg have be too much for his year and strength . since they have be pick up he have lie amid the soldier with hardly a sign of life save for his thin breathing and the twitch of his scraggy throat . now , however , at the sound of the cannon and the shouting he open his eye , and raise himself slowly and painfully upon his pillow . " what be it , father ? what can we do for you ? " cry . " we be in , and here be and here be i , your child . " but the old man shake his head . " the have bring me to the promised land , but he have not will that i should enter into it , " say he . " may his will be do , and bless be his name forever ! but at least i should wish , like , to gaze upon it , if i can set foot upon it . think you , , that you could lend me your arm and lead me on to the deck ? " " if i have another to help me , " say , and ascend to the deck , he bring back with him . " now , father , if you will lay a hand upon the shoulder of each , you need scarce put your foot to the board . " a minute later the old merchant be on the deck , and the two young man have seat him upon a coil of rope with his back against the mast , where he should be away from the crush . the soldier be already crowd down into the boat , and all be so busy over their own affair that they pay no heed to the little group of refugee who gather round the stricken man . he turn his head painfully from side to side , but his eye brighten as they fall upon the broad blue stretch of water , the flash of the distant fall , the high castle , and the long line of purple mountain away to the . " it be not like , " say he . " it be not green and peaceful and smile , but it be grand and strong and stern like who make it . as i have weaken , , my soul have be less clog by my body , and i have see clearly much that have be dim to me . and it have seem to me , my child , that all this country of , not alone , but the land where you be bear also , , and all that stretch away towards yonder set sun , will be the good gift of to man . for this have he hold it conceal through all the age , that now his own high purpose may be wrought upon it . for here be a land which be innocent , which have no past guilt to atone for , no feud , nor ill custom , nor evil of any kind . and as the year roll on all the weary and homeless one , all who be stricken and landless and wrong , will turn their face to it , even as we have do . and hence will come a nation which will surely take all that be good and leave all that be bad , mould and fashion itself into the high . do i not see such a mighty people , a people who will care more to raise their low than to exalt their will understand that there be more bravery in peace than in war , who will see that all man be brother , and whose heart will not narrow themselves down to their own frontier , but will warm in sympathy with every noble cause the whole world through ? that be what i see , , as i lie here beside a shore upon which i shall never set my foot , and i say to you that if you and go to the building of such a nation then indeed your life be not misspend . it will come , and when it come , may guard it , may watch over it and direct it ! " his head have sink gradually low upon his breast and his lid have fall slowly over his eye which have be look away out past at the rolling wood and the far-off mountain . give a quick cry of despair and throw her arm round the old man 's neck . " he be die , , he be die ! " she cry . a stern franciscan friar , who have be tell his bead within a few pace of them , hear the cry and be beside them in an instant . " he be indeed die , " he say , as he gaze down at the ashen face . " have the old man have the sacrament of the church ? " " i do not think that he need them , " answer evasively . " which of us do not need them , young man ! " say the friar sternly . " and how can a man hope for salvation without them ? i shall myself administer them without delay . " but the old huguenot have open his eye , and with a last flicker of strength he push away the figure which bend over him . " i leave all that i love rather than yield to you , " he cry , " and think you that you can overcome me now ? " the franciscan start back at the word , and his hard suspicious eye shoot from to the weeping girl . " so ! " say he . " you be huguenot , then ! " " hush ! do not wrangle before a man who be die ! " cry in a voice as fierce as his own . " before a man who be dead , " say solemnly . as he speak the old man 's face have relax , his thousand wrinkle have be smooth suddenly out , as though an invisible hand have pass over them , and his head fall back against the mast . remain motionless with her arm still clasp round his neck and her cheek press against his shoulder . she have faint . raise his wife and bear her down to the cabin of one of the lady who have already show them some kindness . death be no new thing aboard the ship , for they have lose ten soldier upon the outward passage , so that amid the joy and bustle of the disembark there be few who have a thought to spare upon the dead pilgrim , and the less so when it be whisper abroad that he have be a huguenot . a brief order be give that he should be bury in the river that very night , and then , save for a who fasten the canvas round him , mankind have do its last for . with the survivor , however , it be different , and when the troop be all disembark , they be muster in a little group upon the deck , and an officer of the governor 's suite decide upon what should be do with them . he be a portly , good-humoured , man , but see with apprehension that the friar walk by his side as he advance along the deck , and exchange a few whisper remark with him . there be a bitter smile upon the monk 's dark face which bode little good for the heretic . " it shall be see to , good father , it shall be see to , " say the officer impatiently , in answer to one of these whisper injunction . " i be as zealous a servant of as you be . " " i trust that you be , monsieur . with so devout a governor as monsieur , it might be an ill thing even in this world for the officer of his household to be lax . " the soldier glance angrily at his companion , for he see the threat which lurk under the word . " i would have you remember , father , " say he , " that if faith be a virtue , charity be no less so . " then , speak in : " which be ? " " of . " " and ? " " of . " " and ? " " of . " " and master mariner , , , and , all of ? " " we be all here . " " it be the governor 's order that all whom i have name shall be convey at once to the trading brig , which be yonder ship with the white paint line . she sail within the hour for the english province . " a buzz of joy break from the castaway mariner at the prospect of be so speedily restore to their home , and they hurry away to gather together the few possession which they have save from the wreck . the officer put his list in his pocket and step across to where lean moodily against the bulwark . " surely you remember me , " he say . " i could not forget your face , even though you have exchange a blue coat for a black one . " grasp the hand which be hold out to him . " i remember you well , , and the journey that we make together to , but it be not for me to claim your friendship , now that thing have go amiss with me . " " tut , man ; once my friend always my friend . " " i fear , too , that my acquaintance would do you little good with yonder friar who be glower behind you . " " well , well , you know how it be with us here . could keep them in their place , but be as clay in their hand , and this new one promise to follow in his step . what with the at and the jesuit here , we poor devil be between the upper and the nether stone . but i be grieve from my heart to give such a welcome as this to an old comrade , and still more to his wife . " " what be to be do , then ? " " you be to be confine to the ship until she sail , which will be in a week at the furthest . " " and then ? " " you be to be carry home in her and hand over to the of to be send back to . those be monsieur 's order , and if they be not carry out to the letter , then we shall have the whole hornet 's nest about our ear . " groan as he listen . after all their and trial and effort , to return to , the scorn of his enemy , and an object of pity to his friend , be too deep a humiliation . he flush with shame at the very think . to be lead back like the peasant who have desert from his regiment ! good one spring into the broad blue river beneath him , be it not for little who have none but him to look to . it be so tame ! so ignominious ! and yet in this floating prison , with a woman whose fate be link with his own , what hope be there of escape ? have leave him , with a few blunt word of sympathy , but the friar still pace the deck with a furtive glance at him from time to time , and two soldier who be station upon the poop pass and repass within a few yard of him . they have order evidently to mark his movement . he lean over the side watch the in their paint and feather shoot backwards and forwards in their canoe , and stare across at the town where the gaunt gable end of house and char wall mark the effect of the terrible fire which a few year before have completely destroy the low part . as he stand gaze , his attention be draw away by the swish of oar , and a large boat full of man pass immediately underneath where he stand . it hold the , who be be convey to the ship which be to take them home . there be the four seaman huddle together , and there in the sheet be and , converse together and point to the shipping . the grizzled face of the old and the bold feature of the woodsman be turn more than once in his direction , but no word of farewell and no kindly wave of the hand come back to the lonely exile . they be so full of their own future and their own happiness , that they have not a thought to spare upon his misery . he could have bear anything from his enemy , but this sudden neglect from his friend come too heavily after his other trouble . he stoop his face to his arm and burst in an instant into a passion of sob . before he raise his eye again the brig have hoist her anchor , and be tack under full canvas out of the basin . that night old be bury from the ship 's side , his sole mourner the two who bear his own blood in their vein . the next day spend upon deck , amid the bustle and confusion of the unlade , endeavour to cheer by light chatter which come from a heavy heart . he point out to her the place which he have know so well , the citadel where he have be quarter , the college of the jesuit , the cathedral of , the magazine of the old company , dismantle by the great fire , and the house of , the only private one which have remain stand in the low part . from where they lie they could see not only the place of interest , but something also of that motley population which make the town so different to all other save only its young sister , . pass and along the steep path with the picket fence which connect the two quarter , they see the whole panorama of canadian life move before their eye , the soldier with their slouch hat , their plume , and their bandoleer , habitant from the river cote in their rude peasant dress , little change from their forefather of or , and young ruffler from or from the seigneury , who cock their hat and swagger in what they think to be the true fashion . there , too , might be see little knot of the man of the wood , or voyageur , with leathern hunting tunic , fringe leggings , and fur cap with eagle feather , who come back once a year to the city , leave their indian wife and child in some wigwam . redskin , too , be there , algonquin fisher and hunter , wild from the east , and savage from the south , while everywhere be the dark habit of the franciscan , and the black cassock and broad hat of the , and jesuit , the move spirit of the whole . such be the folk who crowd the street of the capital of this strange offshoot of which have be plant along the line of the great river , a thousand league from the parent country . and it be a singular settlement , the most singular perhaps that have ever be make . for a long twelve hundred mile it extend , from in the east , away to the trading station upon the border of the great lake , limit itself for the most part to narrow cultivated strip upon the margin of the river , bank in behind by wild forest and unexplored mountain , which forever tempt the peasant from his hoe and his plough to the free life of the paddle and the musket . thin scattered clearing , alternate with little palisade clump of house , mark the line where civilisation be force itself in upon the huge continent , and barely hold its own against the rigour of a northern climate and the ferocity of merciless enemy . the whole white population of this mighty district , include soldier , priest , and woodman , with all woman and child , be very far short of twenty thousand soul , and yet so great be their energy , and such the advantage of the central government under which they live , that they have leave their trace upon the whole continent . when the prosperous english settler be content to live upon their acre , and when no axe have ring upon the further side of the , the have push their daring pioneer , some in the black robe of the missionary , and some in the fringe tunic of the hunter , to the uttermost end of the continent . they have map out the lake and have barter with the fierce sioux on the great plain where the wooden wigwam give place to the hide . have follow the down to the , and have trace the course of the great river until , first of all white man , he look upon the turbid flood of the rush . have venture even further , and have pass the , and have make his way to the , raise the french arm where the city of be afterwards to stand . other have push on to the , and to the huge wilderness of the , preaching , barter , cheating , baptise , sway by many motive and hold only in common a courage which never falter and a fertility of resource which take them in safety past every danger . frenchman be to the north of the british settlement , frenchman be to the west of them , and frenchman be to the south of them , and if all the continent be not now french , the fault assuredly do not rest with that iron race of early canadian . all this explain to during the autumn day , try to draw her thought away from the trouble of the past , and from the long dreary voyage which lie before her . she , fresh from the staid life of the parisian street and from the tame scenery of the , gaze with amazement at the river , the wood and the mountain , and clutch her husband 's arm in horror when a of wild , their face stripe with white and red paint , come fly past with the foam dash from their paddle . again the river turn from blue to pink , again the old citadel be bath in the evening glow , and again the two exile descend to their cabin with cheer word for each other and heavy thought in their own heart . 's bunk be next to a , and it be his custom to keep this open , as the caboose be close to him in which the cooking be do for the crew , and the air be hot and heavy . that night he find it impossible to sleep , and he lie toss under his blanket , think over every possible means by which they might be able to get away from this cursed ship . but even if they get away , where could they go to then ? all be seal to them . the wood to the south be full of ferocious . the english settlement would , it be true , grant them freedom to use their own religion , but what would his wife and he do , without a friend , stranger among folk who speak another tongue ? have remain true to them , then , indeed , all would have be well . but he have desert them . of course there be no reason why he should not . he be no blood relation of theirs . he have already benefit them many time . his own people and the life that he love be wait for him at home . why should he linger here for the sake of folk whom he have know but a few month ? it be not to be expect , and yet could not realise it , could not understand it . but what be that ? above the gentle lap of the river he have suddenly hear a sharp clear " ! " perhaps it be some pass boatman or indian . then it come again , that eager , urgent summons . he sit up and stare about him . it certainly must have come from the open . he look out , but only to see the broad basin , with the loom of the shipping , and the distant twinkle from the light on . as his head drop back upon the pillow something fall upon his chest with a little tap , and roll off , rattle along the board . he spring up , catch a lantern from a hook , and flash it upon the floor . there be the missile which have strike little golden brooch . as he lift it up and look close at it , a thrill pass through him . it have be his own , and he have give it to upon the second day that he have meet him , when they be start together for . this be a signal then , and have not desert them after all . he dress himself , all in a tremble with excitement , and go upon deck . it be pitch dark , and he could see no one , but the sound of regular footfall somewhere in the fore part of the ship show that the sentinel be still there . the guardsman walk over to the side and peer down into the darkness . he could see the loom of a boat . " who be there ? " he whisper . " be that you , ? " yes . " " we have come for you . " " bless you , . " " be your wife there ? " " no , but i can rouse her . " " good ! but first catch this cord . now pull up the ladder ! " grip the line which be throw to him , and on draw it up find that it be attach to a rope ladder furnish at the top with two steel hook to catch on to the bulwark . he place them in position , and then make his way very softly to the cabin amidships in the lady ' quarter which have be allot to his wife . she be the only woman aboard the ship now , so that he be able to tap at her door in safety , and to explain in a few word the need for haste and for secrecy . in ten minute have dress , and with her valuable in a little bundle , have slip out from her cabin . together they make their way upon deck once more , and creep aft under the shadow of the bulwark . they be almost there when stop suddenly and ground out an oath through his clench tooth . between them and the rope ladder there be stand in a dim patch of murky light the grim figure of a franciscan friar . he be peer through the darkness , his heavy cowl shadow his face , and he advance slowly as if he have catch a glimpse of them . a lantern hang from the mizzen shroud above him . he unfasten it and hold it up to cast its light upon them . but be not a man with whom it be safe to trifle . his life have be one of quick resolve and prompt action . be this vindictive friar at the last moment to stand between him and freedom ? it be a dangerous position to take . the guardsman pull into the shadow of the mast , and then , as the monk advance , he spring out upon him and seize him by the gown . as he do so the other 's cowl be push back , and instead of the harsh feature of the ecclesiastic , see with amazement in the glimmer of the lantern the shrewd gray eye and strong tern face of . at the same instant another figure appear over the side , and the warm-hearted frenchman throw himself into the arm of . " it be all right , " say the young hunter , disengage himself with some embarrassment from the other be embrace . " we have get him in the boat with a buckskin glove jam into his gullet ! " " who then ? " " the man whose cloak there have put round him . he come on us when you be away rouse your lady , but we get him to be quiet between us . be the lady there ? " " here she be . " " as quick as you can , then , for some one may come along . " be help over the side , and seat in the stern of a birch-bark canoe . the three man unhook the ladder , and swing themselves down by a rope , while two , who hold the paddle , push silently off from the ship 's side , and shoot swiftly up the stream . a minute later a dim loom behind them , and the glimmer of two yellow light , be all that they could see of the " take a paddle , , and i will take one , " say , strip off his monk 's gown . " i feel safe in this on the deck of yon ship , but it do n't help in a boat . i believe we might have fasten the hatch and take her , brass gun and all , have we be so mind . " " and be hang as pirate at the yard-arm next morning , " say . " i think we have do good to take the honey and leave the tree . i hope , madame , that all be well with you . " " nay , i can hardly understand what have happen , or where we be . " " nor can i , . " " do you not expect us to come back for you , then ? " " i do not know what to expect . " " well , now , but surely you could not think that we would leave you without a word . " " i confess that i be cut to the heart by it . " " i fear that you be when i look at you with the tail of my eye , and see you stare so blackly over the bulwark at us . but if we have be see talk or plan they would have be upon our trail at once . as it be they have not a thought of suspicion , save only this fellow whom we have in the bottom of the boat here . " " and what do you do ? " " we leave the brig last night , get ashore on the side , arrange for this canoe , and lie dark all day . then we get alongside and i rouse you easily , for i know where you sleep . the friar nearly spoil all when you be below , but we gag him and pass him over the side . pop on his gown so that he might go forward to help you without danger , for we be scare at the delay . " " ah ! it be glorious to be free once more . what do i not owe you , ? " " well , you look after me when i be in your country , and i be go to look after you now . " " and where be we go ? " " ah ! there you have me . it be this way or none , for we ca n't get down to the sea . we must make our way over land as good we can , and we must leave a good stretch between citadel and us before the day break , for from what i hear they would rather have a huguenot prisoner than an iroquois sagamore . by the eternal , i can see why they should make such a fuss over how a man choose to save his own soul , though here be old just as fierce upon the other side , so all the folly be not one way . " " what be you say about me ? " ask the seaman , prick up his ear at the mention of his own name . " only that you be a good stiff old protestant . " " yes , thank . my motto be freedom to conscience , see , except just for quaker , and papist , i would n't stand and woman testify , and suchlike foolishness . " laugh . " the seem to pass it over , so why should you take it to heart ? " say he . " ah , you be young and callow yet . you will live to know well . why , i shall hear you say a good word soon even for such unclean spawn as this , " prod the prostrate friar with the handle of his paddle . " i he be a good man , ' to his light . " " and i a shark be a good fish ' to its light . no , lad , you wo n't mix up light and dark for me in that sort of fashion . you may talk until you unship your jaw , see , but you will never talk a foul wind into a fair one . pass over the pouch and the tinder-box , and maybe our friend here will take a turn at my paddle . " all night they toil up the great river , strain every nerve to place themselves beyond the reach of pursuit . by keep well into the southern bank , and so avoid the force of the current , they speed swiftly along , for both and be practise hand with the paddle , and the two work as though they be wire and whipcord instead of flesh and blood . an utter silence reign over all the broad stream , break only by the of the water against their curve bow , the whir of the night hawk above them , and the sharp high bark of fox away in the wood . when at last morning break , and the black shade imperceptibly into gray , they be far out of sight of the citadel and of all trace of man 's handiwork . virgin wood in their wonderful autumn dress flow right down to the river edge on either side , and in the centre be a little island with a rim of yellow sand and an of scarlet tupelo and sumach in one bright tangle of colour in the centre . " i have pass here before , " say . " i remember mark that great maple with the blaze on its trunk , when last i go with the governor to . that be in 's day , when the king be first and the bishop second . " the , who have sit like terra-cotta figure , without a trace of expression upon their set hard face , prick up their ear at the sound of that name . " my brother have speak of the great , " say one of them , glance round . " we have listen to the whistling of evil bird who tell us that he will never come back to his child across the sea . " " he be with the great white father , " answer . " i have myself see him in his council , and he will assuredly come across the great water if his people have need of him . " the shake his shaven head . " the rut month be past , my brother , " say he , speak in break french , " but ere the month of the have come there will be no white man upon this river save only behind stone wall . " " what , then ? we have hear little ! have the break out so fiercely ? " " my brother , they say they would eat up the , and where be the now ? they turn their face upon the , and where be the now ? they go westward against the , and who can find an village ? they raise the hatchet against the , and their name be blot from the earth . and now they have dance a dance and sing a song which will bring little good to my white brother . " " where be they , then ? " the wave his hand along the whole southern and western horizon . " where be they not ? the wood be rustle with them . they be like a fire among dry grass , so swift and so terrible ! " " on my life , " say , " if these devil be indeed unchain , they will need old back if they be not to be sweep into the river . " " ay , " say , " i see him once , when i be bring before him with the other for trading on what he call french ground . his mouth set like a skunk trap and he look at us as if he would have like our scalp for his leggings . but i could see that he be a chief and a brave man . " " he be an enemy of the , and the right hand of the foul fiend in this country , " say a voice from the bottom of the canoe . it be the friar who have succeed in get rid of the buckskin glove and belt with which the two have gag him . he be lie huddle up now glare savagely at the party with his fiery dark eye . " his have come adrift , " say the seaman . " let me brace it up again . " " , why should we take him farther ? " ask . " he be but weight for us to carry , and i can see that we profit by his company . let us put him out . " " ay , sink or swim , " cry old with enthusiasm . " nay , upon the bank . " " and have him maybe in front of us warn the black jacket . " " on that island , then . " " very good . he can hail the first of his folk who pass . " they shoot over to the island and land the friar , who say nothing , but curse them with his eye . they leave with him a small supply of biscuit and of flour to last him until he should be pick up . then , have pass a bend in the river , they run their canoe ashore in a little cove where the whortleberry and cranberry bush grow right down to the water 's edge , and the sward be bright with the white euphorbia , the blue gentian , and the purple balm . there they lay out their small stock of provision , and eat a hearty breakfast while discuss what their plan should be for the future . they be not badly provide for their journey . the captain of the brig in which the have start from know well , as who do not upon the coast ? he have accept his bill therefore at three month ' date , at as high a rate of interest as he could screw out of him , and he have let him have in return three excellent gun , a good supply of ammunition , and enough money to provide for all his want . in this way he have hire the canoe and the , and have fit her with meat and biscuit to last them for ten day at the least . " it be like the breath of life to me to feel the heft of a gun and to smell the tree round me , " say . " why , it can be more than a hundred league from here to or , right through the forest . " " ay , lad , but how be the gal to walk a hundred league through a forest ? no , no , let us keep water under our keel , and lean on the . " " then there be only one way for it . we must make the , and keep right along to and . there we should be close by the headwaters of the . " " it be a dangerous road , " say , who understand the conversation of his companion , even when he be unable to join in it . " we should need to skirt the country of the mohawk . " " it be the only way , i guess . it be that or nothing . " " and i have a friend upon the river who , i be sure , would help us on our way , " say with a smile . " , you have hear me talk of , seigneur ? " " he whom you use to call the canadian duke , ? " " precisely . his seigneury lie on the , a little south of , and i be sure that he would speed us upon our way . " " good ! " cry . " if we have a friend there we shall do well . that clench it then , and we shall hold fast by the river . let be get to our paddle then , for that friar will make mischief for us if he can . " and so for a long week the little party toil up the great waterway , keep ever to the southern bank , where there be few clearing . on both side of the stream the wood be thick , but every here and there they would curve away , and a narrow strip of cultivated land would skirt the bank , with the yellow stubble to mark where the wheat have grow . look with interest at the wooden house with their jut storey and quaint , at the solid , manor-house of the seigneur , and at the mill in every hamlet , which serve the double purpose of grind flour and of a place of retreat in case of attack . horrible experience have teach the canadian what the english settler have yet to learn , that in a land of savage it be a folly to place isolated farmhouse in the centre of their own field . the clearing then radiate out from the village , and every cottage be build with an eye to the military necessity of the whole , so that the defence might make a stand at all point , and might finally centre upon the stone manor-house and the mill . now at every bluff and hill near the village might be see the gleam of the musket of the watcher , for it be know that the scalp party of the five be out , and none could tell where the blow would fall , save that it must come where they be least prepare to meet it . indeed , at every step in this country , whether the traveller be on the , or west upon the lake , or down upon the bank of the , or south in the country of the cherokee and of the , he would still find the inhabitant in the same state of dreadful expectancy , and from the same cause . the , as they be name by the french , or the five as they call themselves , hang like a cloud over the whole great continent . their confederation be a natural one , for they be of the same stock and speak the same language , and all attempt to separate them have be in vain . mohawk , , , , and be each proud of their own totem and their own chief , but in war they be iroquois , and the enemy of one be the enemy of all . their number be small , for they be never able to put two thousand warrior in the field , and their country be limit , for their village be scatter over the tract which lie between and . but they be unite , they be cunning , they be desperately brave , and they be fiercely aggressive and energetic . hold a central position , they strike out upon each side in turn , never content with simply defeat an adversary , but absolutely annihilate and destroy him , while hold all the other in check by their diplomacy . war be their business , and cruelty their amusement . one by one they have turn their arm against the various nation , until , for a space of over a thousand square mile , none exist save by sufferance . they have sweep away and mission in one fearful massacre . they have destroy the tribe of the , until even the distant and tremble at their name . they have scour the whole country to westward until their scalping party have come into touch with their kinsman the , who be lord of the great plain , even as they be of the great forest . the in the east , and the and farther south , pay tribute to them , and the terror of their arm have extend over the border of and . never , perhaps , in the world 's history have so small a body of man dominate so large a district and for so long a time . for half a century these tribe have nurse a grudge ward the french since and some of his follower have take part with their enemy against them . during all these year they have brood in their forest village , flash out now and again in some border outrage , but wait for the most part until their chance should come . and now it seem to them that it have come . they have destroy all the tribe who might have ally themselves with the white man . they have isolate them . they have supply themselves with good gun and plenty of ammunition from the and of . the long thin line of french settlement lie naked before them . they be gather in the wood , like hound in leash , wait for the order of their chief , which should precipitate them with torch and with tomahawk upon the belt of village . such be the situation as the little party of refugee paddle along the bank of the river , seek the only path which could lead them to peace and to freedom . yet it be , as they well know , a dangerous road to follow . all down the be the outpost and blockhouse of the french , for when the feudal system be graft upon the various seigneur or native noblesse be assign their estate in the position which would be of most benefit to the settlement . each seigneur with his tenant under him , train as they be in the use of arm , form a military force exactly as they have do in the middle age , the farmer hold his fief upon condition that he muster when call upon to do so . hence the old officer of the regiment of , and the more hardy of the settler , have be place along the line of the , which run at right angle to the towards the mohawk country . the blockhouse themselves might hold their own , but to the little party who have to travel down from one to the other the situation be full of deadly peril . it be true that the be not at war with the english , but they would discriminate little when on the warpath , and the , even have they wish to do so , could not separate their fate from that of their two french companion . as they ascend the they meet many canoe come down . sometimes it be an officer or an official on his way to the capital from or , sometimes it be a load of skin , with or convey them down to be ship to , and sometimes it be a small canoe which bear a sunburned man , with rusty black cassock , who zigzag from bank to bank , stop at every indian hut upon his way . if aught be amiss with the in the fault lie not with man like these village priest , who toil and work and spend their very life in bear comfort and hope , and a little touch of refinement too , through all those wild . more than once these wayfarer wish to have speech with the fugitive , but they push onwards , disregard their sign and hail . from below nothing overtake them , for they paddle from early morning until late at night , draw up the canoe when they halt , and build a fire of dry wood , for already the nip of the come winter be in the air . it be not only the people and their dwelling which be stretch out before the wonder eye of the french girl as she sit day after day in the stern of the canoe . her husband and teach her also to take notice of the sight of the woodland , and as they skirt the bank , they point out a thousand thing which her own sense would never have discern . sometimes it be the furry face of a raccoon peep out from some , or an otter swimming under the overhang brushwood with the gleam of a white fish in its mouth . or , perhaps , it be the wild cat crouch along a branch with its wicked yellow eye fix upon the squirrels which play at the farther end , or else with a scuttle and rush the canadian porcupine would thrust its way among the yellow blossom of the resin weed and the tangle of the whortleberry bush . she learn , too , to recognise the pert sharp cry of the tiny , the call of the , and the flash of its wing amid the foliage , the sweet chirpy note of the black and white bobolink , and the mew of the . on the breast of the broad blue river , with 's sweet concert ever sound from the bank , and with every colour that artist could devise spread out before her eye on the foliage of the die wood , the smile come back to her lip , and her cheek take a glow of health which have never be able to give . see the change in her , but her presence weigh him down with fear , for he know that while have make these wood a heaven , man have change it into a hell , and that a nameless horror lurk behind all the beauty of the fading leave and of the woodland flower . often as he lie at night beside the smoulder fire upon his couch of spruce , and look at the little figure muffle in the blanket and slumber peacefully by his side , he feel that he have no right to expose her to such peril , and that in the morning they should turn the canoe eastward again and take what fate might bring them at . but ever with the daybreak there come the thought of the humiliation , the dreary homeward voyage , the separation which would await them in galley and dungeon , to turn him from his purpose . on the seventh day they rest at a point but a few mile from the mouth of the , where a large blockhouse , , have be build by . once past this they have no great distance to go to reach the seigneury of 's friend of the noblesse who would help them upon their way . they have spend the night upon a little island in midstream , and at early dawn they be about to thrust the canoe out again from the cove in which she lay , when growl in his throat and point out across the water . a large canoe be come up the river , fly along as quick as a dozen arm could drive it . in the stern sit a dark figure which bend forward with every swing of the paddle , as though consume by eagerness to push onwards . even at that distance there be no mistake it . it be the fanatical monk whom they have leave behind them . conceal among the brushwood , they watch their pursuer fly past and vanish round a curve in the stream . then they look at one another in perplexity . " we will have do well either to put him overboard or to take him as ballast , " say . " he be hull down in front of us now , and draw full . " " well , we ca n't take the back track anyhow , " remark . " and yet how can we go on ? " say despondently . " this vindictive devil will give word at the fort and at every other point along the river . he have be back to . it be one of the governor 's own canoe , and go three pace to our two . " " let me cipher it out . " sit on a fall maple with his head sink upon his hand . " well , " say he presently , " if it be no good go on , and no good go back , there be only one way , and that be to go to one side . that be so , , be it not ? " " ay , ay , lad , if you ca n't run you must tack , but it seem shoal water on either bow . " " we ca n't go to the north , so it follow that we must go to the south . " " leave the canoe ? " " it be our only chance . we can cut through the wood and come out near this friendly house on the . the friar will lose our trail then , and we will have no more trouble with him , if he stay on the . " " there be nothing else for it , " say ruefully . " it be not my way to go by land if i can get by water , and i have not be a fathom deep in a wood since come down on the province , so you must lay the course and keep her straight , . " " it be not far , and it will not take us long . let us get over to the southern bank and we shall make a start . if madame tire , , we shall take turn to carry her . " " ah , monsieur , you can think what a good walker i be . in this splendid air one might go on forever . " " we will cross then . " in a very few minute they be at the other side and have land at the edge of the forest . there the gun and ammunition be allot to each man , and his share of the provision and of the scanty baggage . then have pay the , and have instruct them to say nothing of their movement , they turn their back upon the river and plunge into the silent wood . all day they push on through the woodland , walk in single file , first , then the seaman , then the lady , and bring up the rear . the young woodsman advance cautiously , see and hear much that be lose to his companion , stop continually and examine the sign of leaf and moss and twig . their route lie for the most part through open glade amid a huge pine forest , with a green sward beneath their foot , make beautiful by the white euphorbia , the golden rod , and the purple aster . sometimes , however , the great trunk close in upon them , and they have to grope their way in a dim twilight , or push a path through the tangled brushwood of green sassafras or scarlet sumach . and then again the wood would shred suddenly away in front of them , and they would skirt marsh , overgrow with wild rice and dot with little dark clump of alder bush , or make their way past silent woodland lake , all streak and bar with the tree shadow which throw their crimson and claret and bronze upon the fringe of the deep blue sheet of water . there be stream , too , some clear and ripple where the trout flash and the gleam , other dark and poisonous from the tamarack swamp , where the wanderer have to wade over their knee and carry in their arm . so all day they journey ' mid the great forest , with never a hint or token of their . but if man be absent , there be at least no want of life . it buzz and chirp and chatter all round them from marsh and stream and brushwood . sometimes it be the dun coat of a deer which glance between the distant trunk , sometimes the badger which scuttle for its hole at their approach . once the long track of a bear lie mark in the soft earth before them , and once pick a great horn from amid the bush which some moose have shed the month before . little red squirrel dance and clatter above their head , and every oak be a choir with a hundred tiny voice pipe from the shadow of its foliage . as they pass the lake the heavy gray stork flap up in front of them , and they see the wild duck whir off in a long v against the blue sky , or hear the quaver cry of the loon from amid the reed . that night they sleep in the wood , light a dry wood fire in a thick copse where at a dozen pace it be invisible . a few drop of rain have fall , so with the quick skill of the practise woodsman he make two little shed of elm and basswood bark , one to shelter the two refugee , and the other for and himself . he have shoot a wild goose , and this , with the remain of their biscuit , serve them both for supper and for breakfast . next day at noon they pass a little clearing , in the centre of which be the char ember of a fire . spend half an hour in read all that stick and ground could tell him . then , as they resume their way , he explain to his companion that the fire have be light three week before , that a white man and two indian have camp there , that they have be journey from west to east , and that one of the have be a squaw . no other trace of their do they come across , until late in the afternoon halt suddenly in the heart of a thick grove , and raise his hand to his ear . " listen ! " he cry . " i hear nothing , " say . " nor i , " add . " ah , but i do ! " cry gleefully . " it be a at the very time of day when the bell all sound in ! " " you be right , madame . it be what they call the bell . " " ah , yes , i hear it now ! " cry . " it be drown by the chirp of the bird . but whence come a bell in the heart of a canadian forest ? " " we be near the settlement on the . it must be the bell of the chapel at the fort . " " ! ah , then , we be no great way from my friend 's seigneury . " " then we may sleep there , if you think that he be indeed to be trust . " " yes . he be a strange man , with way of his own , but i would trust him with my life . " " very good . we shall keep to the south of the fort and make for his house . but something be put up the bird over yonder . ah , i hear the sound of step ! crouch down here among the sumach , until we see who it be who walk so boldly through the wood . " they stoop all four among the brushwood , peep out between the tree trunk at a little glade towards which be look . for a long time the sound which the quick ear of the woodsman have detect be inaudible to the other , but at last they too hear the sharp snap of twig as some one force his passage through the undergrowth . a moment later a man push his way into the open , whose appearance be so strange and so ill-suited to the spot , that even gaze upon him with amazement . he be a very small man , so dark and that he might have pass for an be it not that he walk and be clad as no have ever be . he wear a broad-brimmed hat , fray at the edge , and so discolour that it be hard to say what its original tint have be . his dress be of skin , rudely cut and dangle loosely from his body , and he wear the high boot of a dragoon , as tatter and stain as the rest of his raiment . on his back he bear a huge bundle of canvas with two long stick project from it , and under each arm he carry what appear to be a large square painting . " he be no , " whisper , " and he be no either . bless if i ever see the match of him ! " " he be neither voyageur , nor soldier , nor , " say . " ' to me to have a rig upon his back , and fore and main staysail set under each of his arm , " say . " well , he seem to have no consort , so we may hail him without fear . " they rise from their ambush , and as they do so the stranger catch sight of them . instead of show the uneasiness which any man might be expect to feel at suddenly find himself in the presence of stranger in such a country , he promptly alter his course and come towards them . as he cross the glade , however , the sound of the distant bell fall upon his ear , and he instantly whip off his hat and sink his head in prayer . a cry of horror rise , not only from but from everyone of the party , at the sight which meet their eye . the top of the man 's head be go . not a vestige of hair or of white skin remain , but in place of it be a dreadful crinkle discolour surface with a sharp red line run across his brow and round over his ear . " by the eternal ! " cry , " the man have lose his scalp ! " " ! " say . " look at his hand ! " he have raise them in prayer . two or three little stump project upwards show where the finger have be . " i have see some queer figure-head in my life , but never one like that , " say . it be indeed a most extraordinary face which confront them as they advance . it be that of a man who might have be of any age and of any nation , for the feature be so distort that nothing could be learn from them . one eyelid be droop with a pucker and flatness which show that the ball be go . the other , however , shoot as bright and merry and kindly a glance as ever come from a choose favourite of fortune . his face be fleck over with peculiar brown spot which have a most hideous appearance , and his nose have be burst and shatter by some terrific blow . and yet , in spite of this dreadful appearance , there be something so noble in the carriage of the man , in the pose of his head and in the expression which still hang , like the scent from a crushed flower , round his distorted feature , that even the blunt seaman be awe by it . " , my child , " say the stranger , pick up his picture again and advance towards them . " i presume that you be from the fort , though i may be permit to observe that the wood be not very safe for lady at present . " " we be go to the manor-house of at , " say , " and we hope soon to be in a place of safety . but i grieve , sir , to see how terribly you have be mishandle . " " ah , you have observe my little injury , then ! they know no good , poor soul . they be but mischievous but mischievous . tut , tut , it be laughable indeed that a man 's vile body should ever clog his spirit , and yet here be i full of the will to push forward , and yet i must even seat myself on this log and rest myself , for the rogue have blow the calf of my leg off . " " ! blow them off ! the devil ! " " ah , but they be not to be blame . no , no , it would be uncharitable to blame them . they be ignorant poor folk , and the prince of darkness be behind them to urge them on . they sink little charge of powder into my leg and then they explode them , which make me a slow walker than ever , though i be never very brisk . ' the ' be what i be call at school in , yes , and afterwards at the seminary i be always ' the snail . ' " " who be you then , sir , and who be it who have use you so shamefully ? " ask . " oh , i be a very humble person . i be , of the of , and as to the people who have use me a little roughly , why , if you be send upon the iroquois mission , of course you know what to expect . i have nothing at all to complain of . why , they have use me very much good than they do , , and a good many other whom i could mention . there be time , it be true , when i be quite hopeful of martyrdom , especially when they think my tonsure be too small , which be their merry way of put it . but i suppose i be not worthy of it ; indeed i know that i be not , so it only end in just a little roughness . " " where be you go then ? " ask , who have listen in amazement to the man 's word . " i be go to . you see i be such a useless person that , until i have see the bishop , i can really do no good at all . " " you mean that you will resign your mission into the bishop 's hand ? " say . " oh , no . that would be quite the sort of thing which i should do if i be leave to myself , for it be incredible how cowardly i be . you would not think it possible that a priest of could be so frightened as i be sometimes . the mere sight of a fire make me shrink all into myself ever since i go through the ordeal of the lighted pine splinter , which have leave all these ugly stain upon my face . but then , of course , there be the order to be think of , and member of the do not leave their post for trifling cause . but it be against the rule of that a maim man should perform the rite , and so , until i have see the bishop and have his dispensation , i shall be even more useless than ever . " " and what will you do then ? " " oh , then , of course , i will go back to my flock . " " to the ! " " that be where i be station . " " , " say , " i have spend my life among brave man , but i think that this be the brave man that i have ever meet ! " " on my word , " say , " i have see some good man , too , but never one that i think be good than this . you be weary , father . have some of our cold goose , and there be still a drop of cognac in my flask . " " tut , tut , my son , if i take anything but the very simple living it make me so lazy that i become a snail indeed . " " but you have no gun and no food . how do you live ? " " oh , the good have place plenty of food in these forest for a traveller who dare not eat very much . i have have wild plum , and wild grape , and nut and cranberry , and a nice little dish of from the rock . " the woodsman make a wry face at the mention of this delicacy . " i have as soon eat a pot of glue , " say he . " but what be this which you carry on your back ? " " it be my church . ah , i have everything here , tent , altar , surplice , everything . i can venture to celebrate service myself without the dispensation , but surely this venerable man be himself in order and will solemnise the most blessed function . " , with a sly twinkle of the eye , translate the proposal to , who stand with his huge red hand clench , mumble about the saltless pottage of papacy . reply briefly , however , that they be all of the laity , and that if they be to reach their destination before nightfall , it be necessary that they should push on . " you be right , my son , " say the little jesuit . " these poor people have already leave their village , and in a few day the wood will be full of them , though i do not think that any have cross the yet . there be one thing , however , which i would have you do for me . " " and what be that ? " " it be but to remember that i have leave with at the dictionary which i have make of the iroquois and french language . there also be my account of the copper mine of the which i visit two year ago , and also an orrery which i have make to show the northern heaven with the star of each month as they be see from this meridian . if aught be to go amiss with or with me , and we do not live very long on the iroquois mission , it would be well that some one else should profit from my work . " " i will tell my friend . but what be these great picture , father , and why do you bear them through the wood ? " he turn them over as he speak , and the whole party gather round them , stare in amazement . they be very rough daub , crudely coloured and gaudy . in the first , a red man be repose serenely upon what appear to be a range of mountain , with a musical instrument in his hand , a crown upon his head , and a smile upon his face . in the second , a similar man be scream at the pitch of his lung , while half-a-dozen black creature be batter him with pole and prod him with lance . " it be a damned soul and a save soul , " say , look at his picture with some satisfaction . " these be cloud upon which the blessed spirit recline , bask in all the joy of paradise . it be well do this picture , but it have have no good effect , because there be no beaver in it , and they have not paint in a . you see they have little reason , these poor folk , and so we have to teach them as good we can through their eye and their foolish sense . this other be good . it have convert several squaw and more than one indian . i shall not bring back the save soul when i come in the spring , but i shall bring five damned soul , which will be one for each nation . we must fight satan with such weapon as we can get , you see . and now , my child , if you must go , let me first call down a blessing upon you ! " and then occur a strange thing , for the beauty of this man 's soul shine through all the wretched cloud of sect , and , as he raise his hand to bless them , down go those protestant knee to earth , and even old find himself with a softened heart and a bent head listen to the word of this crippled , , little stranger . " farewell , then , " say he , when they have rise . " the sunshine of be upon you , and may of shield you at the moment of your danger . " and so they leave him , a grotesque and yet heroic figure , stagger along through the wood with his tent , his picture , and his mutilation . if the of should ever be wreck it may come from her weakness in high place , where all be at their weak , or it may be because with what be very narrow she try to explain that which be very broad , but assuredly it will never be through the fault of her rank and file , for never upon earth have man and woman spend themselves more lavishly and more splendidly than in her service . leave , whence the bell have sound , upon their right , they push onwards as swiftly as they could , for the sun be so low in the heaven that the bush in the clearing throw shadow like tree . then suddenly , as they peer in front of them between the trunk , the green of the sward turn to the blue of the water , and they see a broad river run swiftly before them . in it would have seem a mighty stream , but , come fresh from the vastness of the , their eye be use to great sheet of water . but and have both be upon the bosom of the before , and their heart bound as they look upon it , for they know that this be the straight path which lead them , the one to home , and the other to peace and freedom . a few day ' journey down there , a few more along the lovely lake of and , under the shadow of the , and they would be at the headquarters of the , and their toil and their danger be but a thing of gossip for the winter evening . across the river be the terrible iroquois country , and at two point they could see the smoke of fire curl up into the evening air . they have the jesuit 's word for it that none of the have cross yet , so they follow the track which lead down the eastern bank . as they push onwards , however , a stern military challenge suddenly bring them to a stand , and they see the gleam of two musket barrel which cover them from a thicket overlook the path . " we be friend , " cry . " whence come you , then ? " ask an invisible sentinel . " from . " " and whither be you go ? " " to visit monsieur de la , seigneur of . " " very good . it be quite safe , . they have a lady with them , too . i greet you , madame , in the name of my father . " two man have emerge from the bush , one of whom might have pass as a full-blooded , have it not be for these courteous word which he utter in excellent . he be a tall slight young man , very dark , with pierce black eye , and a grim square relentless mouth which could only have come with indian descent . his coarse flowing hair be gather up into a , and the eagle feather which he wear in it be his only headgear . a rude suit of fringe hide with might have be the fellow to the one which be wear , but the gleam of a gold chain from his belt , the sparkle of a costly ring upon his finger , and the delicate musket which he carry , all give a touch of grace to his equipment . a broad band of yellow ochre across his forehead and a tomahawk at his belt add to the strange inconsistency of his appearance . the other be undoubtedly a pure frenchman , elderly , dark and wiry , with a bristle black beard and a fierce eager face . he , too , be clad in hunter 's dress , but he wear a gaudy striped sash round his waist , into which a brace of long pistol have be thrust . his buckskin tunic have be ornament over the front with dye porcupine quill and indian , while his leggings be scarlet with a fringe of raccoon tail hang down from them . lean upon his long brown gun he stand watch the party , while his companion advance towards them . " you will excuse our precaution , " say he . " we never know what device these rascal may adopt to entrap us . i fear , madame , that you have have a long and very tire journey . " , who have be fame for neatness even among housekeeper of the , hardly dare to look down at her own stain and tatter dress . fatigue and danger she have endure with a smile face , but her patience almost give way at the thought of face stranger in this attire . " my mother will be very glad to welcome you , and to see to every want , " say he quickly , as though he have read her thought . " but you , sir , i have surely see you before . " " and i you , " cry the guardsman . " my name be , once of the regiment of . surely you be de la de , whom i remember when you come with your father to the government levee at . " " yes , it be i , " the young man answer , hold out his hand and smile in a somewhat constrain fashion . " i do not wonder that you should hesitate , for when you see me last i be in a very different dress to this . " do indeed remember him as one of the band of the young noblesse who use to come up to the capital once a year , where they inquire about the late mode , chat over the year-old gossip of , and for a few week at least live a life which be in keep with the tradition of their order . very different be he now , with and war-paint , under the shadow of the great oak , his musket in his hand and his tomahawk at his belt . " we have one life for the forest and one for the city , " say he , " though indeed my good father will not have it so , and carry with him wherever he go . you know him of old , monsieur , and i need not explain my word . but it be time for our relief , and so we may guide you home . " two man in the rude dress of canadian or farmer , but carry their musket in a fashion which tell 's train sense that they be discipline soldier , have suddenly appear upon the scene . give them a few curt injunction , and then accompany the refugee along the path . " you may not know my friend here , " say he , point to the other sentinel , " but i be quite sure that his name be not unfamiliar to you . this be . " both and look with the deep curiosity and interest at the famous leader of , a man whose whole life have be spend in push westward , ever westward , say little , write nothing , but always the first wherever there be danger to meet or difficulty to overcome . it be not religion and it be not hope of gain which lead him away into those western wilderness , but pure love of nature and of adventure , with so little ambition that he have never care to describe his own travel , and none know where he have be or where he have stop . for year he would vanish from the settlement away into the vast plain of the , or into the huge wilderness of the , and then at last some day would walk back into , or any other outpost of civilisation , a little lean , a little brown , and as taciturn as ever . from the furthest corner of the continent know him as they know their own sachem . he could raise tribe and bring a thousand painted cannibal to the help of the who speak a tongue which none know , and come from the shore of river which no one else have visit . the most daring french explorer , when , after a thousand danger , they have reach some country which they believe to be new , be as likely as not to find sit by his camp fire there , some new squaw by his side , and his pipe between his tooth . or again , when in doubt and danger , with no friend within a thousand mile , the traveller might suddenly meet this silent man , with one or two tatter wanderer of his own kidney , who would help him from his peril , and then vanish as unexpectedly as he come . such be the man who now walk by their side along the bank of the , and both and know that his presence there have a sinister meaning , and that the place which have choose be the place where the danger threaten . " what do you think of those fire over yonder , ? " ask young la . the adventurer be stuff his pipe with rank indian tobacco , which he pare from a plug with a scalping knife . he glance over at the two little plume of smoke which stand straight up against the red evening sky . " i do n't like them , " say he . " they be iroquois then ? " " yes . " " well , at least it prove that they be on the other side of the river . " " it prove that they be on this side . " " what ! " light his pipe from a tinder paper . " the be on this side , " say he . " they cross to the south of us . " " and you never tell us . how do you know that they cross , and why do you not tell us ? " " i do not know until i see the fire over yonder . " " and how do they tell you ? " " tut , an indian papoose could have tell , " say impatiently . " iroquois on the trail do nothing without an object . they have an object then in show that smoke . if their be over yonder there would be no object . therefore their brave must have cross the river . and they could not get over to the north without be see from the fort . they have get over on the south then . " nod with intense appreciation . " that be it ! " say he , " that be way . i will lay that he be right . " " then they may be in the wood round us . we may be in danger , " cry . nod and suck at his pipe . cast a glance round him at the grand tree trunk , the fading foliage , the smooth sward underneath with the long evening shadow bar across it . how difficult it be to realise that behind all this beauty there lurk a danger so deadly and horrible that a man alone might well shrink from it , far less one who have the woman whom he love walk within hand 's touch of him . it be with a long sigh of relief that he see a wall of stockade in the midst of a large clearing in front of him , with the stone manor house rise above it . in a line from the stockade be a dozen cottage with roof turn up in the fashion , in which dwell the habitant under the protection of the seigneur 's strange little graft of the feudal system in the heart of an american forest . above the main gate as they approach be a huge shield of wood with a coat of arm paint upon it , a silver ground with a chevron ermine between three coronet gules . at either corner a small brass cannon peep through an embrasure . as they pass the gate the guard inside close it and place the huge wooden bar into position . a little crowd of man , woman , and child be gather round the door of the chateau , and a man appear to be seat on a high-backed chair upon the threshold . " you know my father , " say the young man with a shrug of his shoulder . " he will have it that he have never leave his castle , and that he be still the , the great man within a day 's ride of , and of the rich blood of . he be now take his due and his yearly oath from his tenant , and he would not think it become , if the governor himself be to visit him , to pause in the middle of so august a ceremony . but if it would interest you , you may step this way and wait until he have finish . you , madame , i will take at once to my mother , if you will be so kind as to follow me . " the sight be , to the at least , a novel one . a triple row of man , woman , and child be stand round in a semicircle , the man rough and sunburned , the woman homely and clean , with white cap upon their head , the child open-mouthed and round-eyed , awe into an unusual quiet by the reverent bearing of their elder . in the centre , on his high-backed carve chair , there sit an elderly man very stiff and erect , with an exceedingly solemn face . he be a fine figure of a man , tall and broad , with large strong feature , clean-shaven and , a huge beak of a nose , and strong shaggy eyebrow which arch right up to the great wig , which he wear full and long as it have be wear in in his youth . on his wig be place a white hat cock jauntily at one side with a red feather stream round it , and he wear a coat of cloth with silver at the neck and pocket , which be still very handsome , though it bear sign of have be fray and mend more than once . this , with black velvet knee-breeches and high boot , make a costume such as have never before see in the wild of . as they watch , a rude husbandman walk forwards from the crowd , and kneel down upon a square of carpet place his hand between those of the seigneur . " monsieur , monsieur , monsieur , " say he three time , " i bring you the faith and homage which i be bind to bring you on account of my fief , which i hold as a man of faith of your seigneury . " " be true , my son . be valiant and true ! " say the old nobleman solemnly , and then with a sudden change of tone : " what in the name of the devil have your daughter get there ? " a girl have advance from the crowd with a large strip of bark in front of her on which be heap a pile of dead fish . " it be your eleventh fish which i be bind by my oath to render to you , " say the . " there be in the heap , and i have catch eight hundred in the month . " ! " cry the nobleman . " do you think , , that i will disorder my health by eat fish in this fashion ? do you think that i and my body-servant and my personal retainer and the other member of my household have nothing to do but to eat your fish ? in future , you will pay your tribute not more than five at a time . where be the major-domo ? , remove the fish to our central store-house , and be careful that the smell do not penetrate to the blue tapestry chamber or to my lady 's suite . " a man in very shabby black livery , all stain and fade , advance with a large tin platter and carry off the pile of white fish . then , as each of the tenant step forward to pay their old-world homage , they all leave some share of their industry for their lord 's maintenance . with some it be a bundle of wheat , with some a barrel of potato , while other have bring skin of deer or of beaver . all these be carry off by the major-domo , until each have pay his tribute , and the singular ceremony be bring to a conclusion . as the seigneur rise , his son , who have return , take by the sleeve and lead him through the throng . " father , " say he , " this be monsieur , whom you may remember some year ago at . " the seigneur bow with much condescension , and shake the guardsman by the hand . " you be extremely welcome to my estate , both you and your -- " " they be my friend , monsieur . this be monsieur and . my wife be travel with me , but your courteous son have kindly take her to your lady . " " i be indeed ! " cry the old man , with a bow and a flourish . " i remember you very well , sir , for it be not so common to meet man of quality in this country . i remember your father also , for he serve with me at , though he be in the foot , and i in the of . your arm be a martlet in fess upon a field azure , and now that i think of it , the second daughter of your marry the son of one of the of , which be one of our cadet branch . , you be welcome ! " he throw his arm suddenly round and slap him three time on the back . the young guardsman be only too delight to find himself admit to such an intimacy . " i will not intrude long upon your hospitality , " say he . " we be journey down to , and we hope in a day or two to be ready to go on . " " a suite of room shall be lay at your disposal as long as you do me the honour to remain here . ! it be not every day that i can open my gate to a man with good blood in his vein ! ah , sir , that be what i feel most in my exile , for who be there with whom i can talk as equal to equal ? there be the governor , the intendant , perhaps , one or two priest , three or four officer , but how many of the noblesse ? scarcely one . they buy their title over here as they buy their pelt , and it be good to have a of beaver skin than a pedigree from . but i forget my duty . you be weary and hungry , you and your friend . come up with me to the tapestried salon , and we shall see if my steward can find anything for your refreshment . you play piquet , if i remember right ? ah , my skill be leave me , and i should be glad to try a hand with you . " the manor-house be high and strong , build of gray stone in a framework of wood . the large door through which they enter be pierce for musketry fire , and lead into a succession of cellar and store-house in which the beet , carrot , potato , cabbage , cure meat , dry eel , and other winter supply be place . a wind stone staircase lead them through a huge kitchen , flag and lofty , from which branch the room of the servant or retainer as the old nobleman preferred to call them . above this again be the principal suite , center in the with its huge fireplace and rude home-made furniture . rich rug form of bear or be litter thickly over the floor , and antlered head bristle out from among the row of musket which be arrange along the wall . a broad rough-hew maple table run down the centre of this apartment , and on this there be soon set a venison pie , a side of salmon , and a huge cranberry tart , to which the hungry traveller do full justice . the seigneur explain that he have already sup , but have allow himself to be persuade into join them , he end by eat more than , drink more than , and finally by sing a very amorous little french with a chorus , the word of which , fortunately for the peace of the company , be entirely unintelligible to the . " madame be take her refection in my lady 's boudoir , " he remark , when the dish have be remove . " you may bring up a bottle of from bin thirteen , . oh , you will see , gentleman , that even in the wild we have a little , a very little , which be perhaps not altogether bad . and so you come from , ? it be build since my day , but how i remember the old life of the court at , before turn serious ! ah , what innocent happy day they be when madame have to bar the window of the maid of honour to keep out the king , and we all turn out eight deep on to the grass plot for our morning duel ! by , i have not quite forget the trick of the wrist yet , and , old as i be , i should be none the bad for a little breather . " he strut in his stately fashion over to where a rapier and dagger hang upon the wall , and begin to make pass at the door , dart in and out , ward off imaginary blow with his poniard , and stamp his foot with little cry of " ! reverso ! ! ! ! " and all the jargon of the fencing school . finally he rejoin them , breathe heavily and with his wig awry . " that be our old exercise , " say he . " doubtless you young blood have improve upon it , and yet it be good enough for the spaniard at and at one or two other place which i could mention . but they still see life at the court , i understand . there be still love passage and blood . how have prosper in his wooing of mademoiselle ? be it prove that madame have buy a phial from , the poison woman , two day before the soup disagree so violently with monsieur ? what do the due do when his nephew run away with the duchess ? be it true that he raise his allowance to fifty thousand livre for have do it ? " such be the two-year-old question which have not be answer yet upon the bank of the . long into the hour of the night , when his comrade be already snore under their blanket , , blink and yawn , be still engage in try to satisfy the curiosity of the old courtier , and to bring him up to date in all the most minute gossip of . two day be spend by the traveller at the seigneury of , and they would very willingly have spend longer , for the quarter be comfortable and the welcome warm , but already the red of autumn be turn to brown , and they know how suddenly the ice and snow come in those northern land , and how impossible it would be to finish their journey if winter be once fairly upon them . the old nobleman have send his scout by land and by water , but there be no sign of the upon the eastern bank , so that it be clear that have be mistake . over on the other side , however , the high gray plume of smoke still stream up above the tree as a sign that their enemy be not very far off . all day from the manor-house window and from the stockade they could see those danger signal which remind them that a horrible death lurk ever at their elbow . the refugee be rest now and refresh , and of one mind about push on . " if the snow come , it will be a thousand time more dangerous , " say , " for we shall leave a track then that a papoose could follow . " " and why should we fear ? " urge old . " truly this be a desert of salt , even though it lead to the vale of , but we shall be bear up against these son of . steer a straight course , lad , and jam your helm , for the pilot will see you safe . " " and i be not frighten , , and i be quite rest now , " say . " we shall be so much more happy when we be in the , for even now , how do we know that that dreadful monk may not come with order to drag us back to and ? " it be indeed very possible that the vindictive franciscan , when satisfy that they have not ascend to , or remain at , might seek them on the bank of the . when think of how he pass them in his great canoe that morning , his eager face protrude , and his dark body swing in time to the paddle , he feel that the danger which his wife suggest be not only possible but imminent . the seigneur be his friend , but the seigneur could not disobey the governor 's order . a great hand , stretch all the way from , seem to hang over them , even here in the heart of the virgin forest , ready to snatch them up and carry them back into degradation and misery . good all the peril of the wood than that ! but the seigneur and his son , who know nothing of their press reason for haste , be strenuous in urge the other way , and in this they be support by the silent , whose few mutter word be always more weighty than the long speech , for he never speak save about that of which he be a master . " you have see my little place , " say the old nobleman , with a wave of his hand . " it be not what i should wish it , but such as it be , it be most heartily yours for the winter , if you and your comrade would honour me by remain . as to madame , i doubt not that my own dame and she will find plenty to amuse and occupy them , which remind me , , that you have not yet be present . , go to your mistress and inform her that i request her to be so good as to come to us in the hall of the dais . " be too seasoned to be easily startle , but he be somewhat take aback when the lady , to whom the old nobleman always refer in term of exaggerated respect , prove to be as like a full-blooded indian squaw as the hall of the dais be to a french barn . she be dress , it be true , in a bodice of scarlet taffeta with a black skirt , shoe , and a scent pomander ball dangle by a silver chain from her girdle , but her face be of the colour of the bark of the scotch fir , while her strong nose and harsh mouth , with the two plait of coarse black hair which dangle down her back , leave no possible doubt as to her origin . " allow me to present you , monsieur , " say the solemnly , " to my wife , de la de , chatelaine by right of marriage to this seigneury , and also to the in , and to the estate of in , while retain in her own right the hereditary chieftainship on the distaff side of the nation of the . my angel , i have be endeavour to persuade our friend to remain with us at instead of journey on to . " " at least leave your at , " say the dusky princess , speak in excellent french , and clasp with her ruddy finger the ivory hand of . " we will hold her safe for you until the ice soften , and the leave and the partridge berry come once more . i know my people , monsieur , and i tell you that the wood be full of murder , and that it be not for nothing that the leave be the colour of blood , for death lurk behind every tree . " be more move by the impressive manner of his hostess than by any of the other warning which he have receive . surely she , if anyone , must be able to read the sign of the time . " i know not what to do ! " he cry in despair . " i must go on , and yet how can i expose her to these peril ? i would fain stay the winter , but you must take my word for it , sir , that it be not possible . " " , you know how thing should be order , " say the seigneur . " what should you advise my friend to do , since he be so set upon get to the before the winter come ? " the dark silent pioneer stroke his beard with his hand as he ponder over the question . " there be but one way , " say he at last , " though even in it there be danger . the wood be safe than the river , for the reed be full of canoe . five league from here be the blockhouse of , and fifteen mile beyond , that of auvergne . we will go to through the wood and see if all be safe . i will go with you , and i give you my word that if the be there , will know it . the lady we shall leave here , and if we find that all be safe we shall come back for her . then in the same fashion we shall advance to auvergne , and there you must wait until you hear where their be . it be in my mind that it will not be very long before we know . " " what ! you would part us ! " cry aghast . " it be good , my sister , " say , pass her arm caressingly round her . " you can know the danger , but we know it , and we will not let our run into it . you will stay here to gladden us , while the great chief , and the french soldier , your husband , and the old warrior who seem so wary , and the other chief with limb like the wild deer , go forward through the wood and see that all be well before you venture . " and so it be at last agree , and , still protest , be consign to the care of the lady of , while swear that without a pause he would return from to fetch her . the old nobleman and his son would fain have join them in their adventure , but they have their own charge to watch and the life of many in their keeping , while a small party be safe in the wood than a large one would be . the seigneur provide them with a letter for , the governor of the blockhouse , and so in the early dawn the four of them creep like shadow from the , amid the mutter good wish of the guard within , and be lose in an instant in the blackness of the vast forest . from to be but twelve mile down the river , but by the woodland route where creek be to be cross , lake to be avoid , and path to be pick among swamp where the wild rice grow high than their head , and the alder bush lie in dense clump before them , the distance be more than double . they walk in single file , lead , with the swift silent tread of some wild creature , his body bent forward , his gun ready in the bend of his arm , and his keen dark eye shoot little glance to right and leave , observe everything from the tiny mark upon the ground or tree trunk to the motion of every beast and bird of the brushwood . walk behind , then , and then , all with their weapon ready and with every sense upon the alert . by midday they be more than half-way , and halt in a thicket for a scanty meal of bread and cheese , for would not permit them to light a fire . " they have not come as far as this , " he whisper , " and yet i be sure that they have cross the river . ah , de la do not know what he do when he stir these man up , and this good dragoon whom the king have send us now know even less . " " i have see them in peace , " remark . " i have trade to and to the country of the . i know them as fine hunter and brave man . " " they be fine hunter , but the game that they hunt good be their . i have myself lead their scalping party , and i have fight against them , and i tell you that when a general come out from who hardly know enough to get the sun behind him in a fight , he will find that there be little credit to be gain from them . they talk of burn their village ! it would be as wise to kick over the wasp ' nest , and think that you have do with the wasp . you be from , monsieur ? " " my comrade be from ; i be from . " " ah , yes . i could see from your step and your eye that the wood be as a home to you . the man go on the water and he slay the cod with more pleasure than the caribou . perhaps that be why his face be so sad . i have be on the great water , and i remember that my face be sad also . there be little wind , and so i think that we may light our pipe without danger . with a good breeze i have know a burning pipe fetch up a scalp party from two mile ' distance , but the tree stop scent , and the iroquois nose be less keen than the and the . help you , monsieur , if you should ever have an indian war . it be bad for us , but it would be a thousand time bad for you . " " and why ? " " because we have fight the from the first , and we have them always in our mind when we build . you see how along this river every house and every hamlet support its neighbour ? but you , by of , it make my scalp tingle when i come on your frontier and see the lonely and little clearing out in the wood with no help for twenty league around . an indian war be a purgatory for , but it would be a hell for the ! " " we be good friend with the , " say . " we do not wish to conquer . " " your people have a way of conquer although they say that they do not wish to do it , " remark . " now , with us , we bang our drum , and wave our flag , and make a stir , but no very big thing have come of it yet . we have never have but two great man in . one be monsieur de la , who be shoot last year by his own man down the great river , and the other , old , will have to come back again if be not to be turn into a desert by the five . it would surprise me little if by this time two year the white and gold flag fly only over the rock of . but i see that you look at me impatiently , monsieur , and i know that you count the hour until we be back at again . forward , then , and may the second part of our journey be as peaceful as the first . " for an hour or more they pick their way through the wood , follow in the step of the old french pioneer . it be a lovely day with hardly a cloud in the heaven , and the sun stream down through the thick foliage cover the shaded sward with a delicate network of gold . sometimes where the wood open they come out into the pure sunlight , but only to pass into thick glade beyond , where a single ray , here and there , be all that could break its way through the vast leafy covering . it would have be beautiful , these sudden transition from light to shade , but with the feeling of impending danger , and of a horror ever lurk in these shadow , the mind be ting with awe rather than admiration . silently , lightly , the four man pick their step among the great tree trunk . suddenly drop upon his knee and stoop his ear to the ground . he rise , shake his head , and walk on with a grave face , cast quick little glance into the shadow in every direction . " do you hear something ? " whisper . put his finger to his lip , and then in an instant be down again upon his face with his ear fix to the ground . he spring up with the look of a man who have hear what he expect to hear . " walk on , " say he quietly , " and behave exactly as you have do all day . " " what be it , then ? " " . " " in front of us ? " " no , behind us . " " what be they do ? " " they be follow us . " " how many of them ? " " two , i think . " the friend glance back involuntarily over their shoulder into the dense blackness of the forest . at one point a single broad shaft of light slide down between two pine and cast a golden blotch upon their track . save for this one vivid spot all be sombre and silent . " do not look round , " whisper sharply . " walk on as before . " " be they enemy ? " " they be iroquois . " " and pursue us ? " " no , we be now pursue them . " " shall we turn , then ? " " no , they would vanish like shadow , " " how far off be they ? " " about two hundred pace , i think . " " they can see us , then ? " " i think not , but i can be sure . they be follow our trail , i think . " " what shall we do , then ? " " let us make a circle and get behind them . " turn sharp to the leave he lead them in a long curve through the wood , hurry swiftly and yet silently under the dark shadow of the tree . then he turn again , and presently halt . " this be our own track , " say he . " ay , and two redskin have pass over it , " cry , bend down , and point to mark which be entirely invisible to or . " a full-grown warrior and a lad on his first warpath , " say . " they be move fast , you see , for you can hardly see the heel mark of their moccasin . they walk one behind the other . now let us follow them as they follow us , and see if we have good luck . " he speed swiftly along the trail with his musket cock in his hand , the other follow hard upon his heel , but there be no sound , and no sign of life from the shadowy wood in front of them . suddenly stop and ground his weapon . " they be still behind us , " he say . " still behind us ? " " yes . this be the point where we branch off . they have hesitate a moment , as you can see by their footmark , and then they have follow on . " " if we go round again and quicken our pace we may overtake them . " " no , they be on their guard now . they must know that it could only be on their account that we go back on our track . lie here behind the fall log and we shall see if we can catch a glimpse of them . " a great rotten trunk , all green with mould and blotch with pink and purple fungus , lie to one side of where they stand . behind this the frenchman crouch , and his three companion follow his example , peer through the brushwood screen in front of them . still the one broad sheet of sunshine pour down between the two pine , but all else be as dim and as silent as a vast cathedral with pillar of wood and roof of leaf . not a branch that creak , nor a twig that snap , nor any sound at all save the sharp bark of a fox somewhere in the heart of the forest . a thrill of excitement run through the nerve of . it be like one of those game of hide-and-seek which the court use to play , when be in a sportive mood , among the oak and yew hedge of . but the forfeit there be a carve fan , or a box of bonbon , and here it be death . ten minute pass and there be no sign of any live thing behind them . " they be over in yonder thicket , " whisper , nod his head towards a dense clump of brushwood , two hundred pace away . " have you see them ? " " no. " " how do you know , then ? " " i see a squirrel come from his hole in the great white yonder . he scuttle back again as if something have scare him . from his hole he can see down into that brushwood . " " do you think that they know that we be here ? " " they can see us . but they be suspicious . they fear a trap . " " shall we rush for the brushwood ? " " they would pick two of us off , and be go like shadow through the wood . no , we have well go on our way . " " but they will follow us . " " i hardly think that they will . we be four and they be only two , and they know now that we be on our guard and that we can pick up a trail as quickly as they can themselves . get behind these trunk where they can see us . so ! now stoop until you be past the belt of alder bush . we must push on fast now , for where there be two iroquois there be likely to be two hundred not very far off . " " thank that i do not bring ! " cry . " yes , monsieur , it be well for a man to make a comrade of his wife , but not on the border of the iroquois country , nor of any other indian country either . " " you do not take your own wife with you when you travel , then ? " ask the soldier . " yes , but i do not let her travel from village to village . she remain in the wigwam . " " then you leave her behind ? " " on the contrary , she be always there to welcome me . by , i should be heavy-hearted if i come to any village between this and the of the , and do not find my wife wait to greet me . " " then she must travel before you . " laugh heartily , without , however , emit a sound . " a fresh village , a fresh wife , " say he . " but i never have more than one in each , for it be a shame for a frenchman to set an evil example when the good father be spend their life so freely in preach virtue to them . ah , here be the , where the set the sturgeon net . it be still seven mile to . " " we shall be there before nightfall , then ? " " i think that we have well wait for nightfall before we make our way in . since the iroquois scout be out as far as this , it be likely that they lie thick round , and we may find the last step the bad unless we have a care , the more so if these two get in front of us to warn the other . " he pause a moment with slanting head and sidelong ear . " by , " he mutter , " we have not shake them off . they be still upon our trail ! " " you hear them ? " " yes , they be no great way from us . they will find that they have follow us once too often this time . now , i will show you a little bit of woodcraft which may be new to you . slip off your moccasin , monsieur . " pull off his shoe as direct , and do the same . " put them on as if they be glove , " say the pioneer , and an instant later and have their comrade ' shoe upon their hand . " you can sling your musket over your back . so ! now down on all four , bend double , with your hand press hard upon the earth . that be excellent . two man can leave the trail of four ! now come with me , monsieur . " he flit from tree to tree on a line which be parallel to , but a few yard distant from , that of their comrade . then suddenly he crouch behind a bush and pull down beside him . " they must pass us in a few minute , " he whisper . " do not fire if you can help it . " something gleam in 's hand , and his comrade , glance down , see that he have draw a keen little tomahawk from his belt . again the mad wild thrill run through the soldier 's blood , as he peer through the tangled branch and wait for whatever might come out of the dim silent aisle of . and suddenly he see something move . it flit like a shadow from one trunk to the other so swiftly that could not have tell whether it be beast or human . and then again he see it , and yet again , sometimes one shadow , sometimes two shadow , silent , furtive , like the with which his nurse have scare him in his childhood . then for a few moment all be still once more , and then in an instant there creep out from among the bush the most creature that ever walk the earth , an iroquois chief upon the . he be a tall powerful man , and his bristle of and eagle feather make him look a giant in the dim light , for a good eight foot lie between his bead moccasin and the topmost plume of his headgear . one side of his face be paint in soot , ochre , and vermilion to resemble a dog , and the other half as a fowl , so that the front view be indescribably grotesque and strange . a belt of wampum be brace round his loin-cloth , and a dozen flutter out as he move from the fringe of his leggings . his head be sink forward , his eye gleam with a sinister light , and his nostril dilate and contract like those of an excited animal . his gun be throw forward , and he creep along with knee , peer , listen , pause , hurry on , a breathe image of caution . two pace behind him walk a lad of fourteen , clad and arm in the same fashion , but without the painted face and without the horrid dry trophy upon the leggings . it be his first campaign , and already his eye shine and his nostril twitch with the same lust for murder which burn within his elder . so they advance , silent , terrible , creep out of the shadow of the wood , as their race have come out of the shadow of history , with body of iron and tiger soul . they be just abreast of the bush when something catch the eye of the young warrior , some displace twig or flutter leaf , and he pause with suspicion in every feature . another instant and he have warn his companion , but spring out and bury his little hatchet in the skull of the old warrior . hear a dull crash , as when an axe splinter its way into a rotten tree , and the man fall like a log , laugh horribly , and kick and strike with his powerful limb . the young warrior spring like a deer over his fall comrade and dash on into the wood , but an instant later there be a gunshot among the tree in front , follow by a faint wail cry . " that be his , " say composedly . " it be a pity to fire , and yet it be well than let him go . " as he speak the two other come back , ram a fresh charge into his musket . " who be laugh ? " ask . " it be he , " say , nod towards the die warrior , who lie with his head in a horrible puddle , and his grotesque feature contort into a fix smile . " it be a custom they have when they get their death-blow . i have know a chief laugh for six hour on end at the . ah , he be go ! " as he speak the give a last spasm with his hand and foot , and lay rigid , grin up at the slit of blue sky above him . " he be a great chief , " say . " he be of the mohawk , and the other be his second son . we have draw first blood , but i do not think that it will be the last , for the do not allow their to die . he be a mighty fighter , as you may see by look at his neck . " he wear a peculiar necklace which seem to to consist of blacken bean pod set upon a string . as he stoop over it he see to his horror that they be not bean pod , but wither human finger . " they be all right , " say , " so everyone represent a life . there be in all . eighteen be of man whom he have slay in battle , and the other have be take and torture . " " how do you know that ? " " because only eighteen have their nail on . if the prisoner of an be alive , he begin always by bite his nail off . you see that they be miss from . " shudder . what demon be these amongst whom an evil fate have drift him ? and be it possible that his should fall into the hand of such fiend ? no , no , surely the good , for whose sake they have suffer so much , would not permit such an infamy ! and yet as evil a fate have come upon other woman as tender as other man as love as he . what hamlet be there in which have not such storey in their record ? a vague horror seize him as he stand there . we know more of the future than we be willing to admit , away down in those dim recess of the soul where there be no reason , but only instinct and impression . now some impending terror cast its cloud over him . the tree around , with their great protrude limb , be like shadowy demon thrust out their gaunt arm to seize him . the sweat burst from his forehead , and he lean heavily upon his musket . " by , " say , " for an old soldier you turn very pale , monsieur , at a little bloodshed . " " i be not well . i should be glad of a sup from your cognac bottle . " " here it be , comrade , and welcome ! well , i may as well have this fine scalp that we may have something to show for our walk . " he hold the 's head between his knee , and in an instant , with a sweep of his knife , have tear off the hideous drip trophy . " let us go ! " cry , turn away in disgust . " yes , we shall go ! but i shall also have this wampum belt mark with the totem of the . so ! and the gun too . look at the ' ' print upon the lock . ah , monsieur , monsieur green , it be not hard to see where the enemy of get their arm . " so at last they turn away , bear his spoil , leave the red grin figure stretch under the silent tree . as they pass on they catch a glimpse of the lad lie double up among the bush where he have fall . the pioneer walk very swiftly until he come to a little stream which prattle down to the big river . here he slip off his boot and leggings , and wade down it with his companion for half a mile or so . " they will follow our track when they find him , " say he , " but this will throw them off , for it be only on run water that an can find no trace . and now we shall lie in this clump until nightfall , for we be little over a mile from , and it be dangerous to go forward , for the ground become more open . " and so they remain conceal among the alder whilst the shadow turn from short to long , and the white drift cloud above them be ting with the pink of the set sun . coil himself into a ball with his pipe between his tooth and drop into a light sleep , prick up his ear and start at the slight sound from the wood around them . the two whisper together for a long time , tell some long story about the cruise of the brig industry , bind to for sugar and molasses , but at last the soothing hum of a gentle breeze through the branch lull them off also , and they sleep . alone remain awake , his nerve still in a tingle from that strange sudden shadow which have fall upon his soul . what could it mean ? not surely that be in danger ? he have hear of such warning , but have he not leave her in safety behind cannon and stockade ? by the next evening at late he would see her again . as he lie look up through the tangle of copper leave at the sky beyond , his mind drift like the cloud above him , and he be back once more in the jut window in the , sit on the broad , with its spanish leather cover , with the gilt creak outside , and his arm round shrinking , timid , she who have compare herself to a little mouse in an old house , and who yet have courage to stay by his side through all this wild journey . and then again he be back at . once more he see the brown eye of the king , the fair bold face of , the serene feature of -- once more he ride on his midnight mission , be drive by the demon coachman , and spring with upon the scaffold to rescue the most beautiful woman in . so clear it be and so vivid that it be with a start that he come suddenly to himself , and find that the night be creep on in an american forest , and that have rouse himself and be ready for a start . " have you be awake ? " ask the pioneer . " yes . " " have you hear anything ? " " nothing but the hoot of the owl . " " it seem to me that in my sleep i hear a gunshot in the distance . " " in your sleep ? " " yes , i hear as well asleep as awake and remember what i hear . but now you must follow me close , and we shall be in the fort soon . " " you have wonderful ear , indeed , " say , as they pick their way through the tangled wood . " how could you hear that these man be follow us ? i could make out no sound when they be within of us . " " i do not hear them at first . " " you see them ? " " no , nor that either . " " then how could you know that they be there ? " " i hear a frightened jay flutter among the tree after we be past it . then ten minute later i hear the same thing . i know then that there be some one on our trail , and i listen . " ! you be a woodsman indeed ! " " i believe that these wood be swarm with , although we have have the good fortune to miss them . so great a chief as would not start on the path with a small following nor for a small object . they must mean mischief upon the . you be not sorry now that you do not bring madame ? " " i thank for it ! " " the wood will not be safe , i fear , until the partridge berry be out once more . you must stay at until then , unless the seigneur can spare man to guard you . " " i have rather stay there forever than expose my wife to such devil . " " ay , devil they be , if ever devil walk upon earth . you wince , monsieur , when i take 's scalp , but when you have see as much of the as i have do your heart will be as harden as mine . and now we be on the very border of the clearing , and the blockhouse lie yonder among the clump of maple . they do not keep very good watch , for i have be expect during these last ten minute to hear the . you do not come as near to unchallenged , and yet be as old a soldier as . we can scarce see now , but yonder , near the river , be where he exercise his man . " " he do so now , " say . " i see a dozen of them draw up in a line at their drill . " " no sentinel , and all the man at drill ! " cry in contempt . " it be as you say , however , for i can see them myself with their rank open , and each as stiff and straight as a pine stump . one would think to see them stand so still that there be not an indian near than . we shall go across to them , and by , i shall tell their commander what i think of his arrangement . " advance from the bush as he speak , and the four man cross the open ground in the direction of the line of man who wait silently for them in the dim twilight . they be within fifty pace , and yet none of them have raise hand or voice to challenge their approach . there be something uncanny in the silence , and a change come over 's face as he peer in front of him . he crane his head round and look up the river . " ! " he scream . " look at the fort ! " they have clear the clump of tree , and the outline of the blockhouse should have show up in front of them . there be no sign of it . it be go ! so unexpected be the blow that even , harden from his childhood to every shock and danger , stand shake and dismay . then , with an oath , he run at the top of his speed towards the line of figure , his companion follow at his heel . as they draw near they could see through the dusk that it be not indeed a line . a silent and motionless officer stand out some twenty pace in front of his silent and motionless man . further , they could see that he wear a very high and singular . they be still rush forward , breathless with apprehension , when to their horror this begin to lengthen and broaden , and a great bird flap heavily up and drop down again on the near tree-trunk . then they know that their bad fear be true , and that it be the garrison of which stand before them . they be lash to low post with willow withy , some twenty of them , naked all , and twist and screw into every strange shape which an agonise body could assume . in front where the buzzard have perch be the commandant , with two cinder thrust into his socket and his flesh hang from him like a beggar 's rag . behind be the line of man , each with his leg char off to the knee , and his body so haggle and scorch and burst that the willow band alone seem to hold it together . for a moment the four comrade stare in silent horror at the dreadful group . then each act as his nature bid him . stagger up against a tree-trunk and lean his head upon his arm , deadly sick . fall down upon his knee and say something to heaven , with his two clench hand shake up at the darken sky . examine the priming of his gun with a tighten lip and a gleam eye , while , without a word , begin to cast round in circle in search of a trail . but be on his foot again in a moment , and run up and down like a sleuth-hound , note a hundred thing which even would have overlook . he circle round the body again and again . then he run a little way towards the edge of the wood , and then come back to the char ruin of the blockhouse , from some of which a thin reek of smoke be still rise . " there be no sign of the woman and child , " say he . " ! there be woman and child ? " " they be keep the child to burn at their leisure in their village . the woman they may torture or may adopt as the humour take them . but what do the old man want ? " " i want you to ask him , , " say the seaman , " why we be yaw and tack here when we should be crack on all sail to stand after them ? " smile and shake his head . " your friend be a brave man , " say he , " if he think that with four man we can follow a hundred and fifty . " " tell him , , that the will bear us up , " say the other excitedly . " say that he will be with us against the child of , and we will cut them off utterly , and they shall be destroy . what be the french for ' slay and spare not ' ? i have as soon go about with my jaw brace up , as with folk who can understand a plain language . " but wave aside the seaman 's suggestion . " we must have a care now , " say he , " or we shall lose our own scalp , and be the cause of those at lose theirs as well . " " ! " cry . " be there then danger at ? " " ay , they be in the wolf 's mouth now . this business be do last night . the place be storm by a of a hundred and fifty man . this morning they leave and go north upon foot . they have be among the wood all day between and . " " then we have come through them ? " " yes , we have come through them . they would keep their camp and send out scout . and his son be among them and strike our trail . -- " " they will attack ? " " it be possible . and yet with so small a party i should scarce have think that they would have dare . well , we can but hasten back as quickly as we can , and give them warn of what be hang over them . " and so they turn for their weary backward journey , though their mind be too full to spare a thought upon the league which lay behind them or those which be before . , less accustomed to walk than his young comrade , be already limp and footsore , but , for all his age , he be as tough as hickory , and full of endurance . take the lead again and they turn their face once more towards the north . the moon be shine brightly in the sky , but it be little aid to the traveller in the depth of the forest . where it have be shadowy in the daytime it be now so absolutely dark that could not see the against which he brush . here and there they come upon an open glade bath in the moonshine , or perhaps a thin shaft of silver light break through between the branch , and cast a great white patch upon the ground , but prefer to avoid these more open space , and to skirt the glade rather than to cross them . the breeze have freshen a little , and the whole air be fill with the rustle and sough of the leave . save for this dull sound all would have be silent have not the owl hoot sometimes from among the , and the whir above their head . dark as it be , walk as swiftly as during the sunlight , and never hesitate about the track . his comrade could see , however , that he be take them a different way to that which they have go in the morning , for twice they catch a sight of the glimmer of the broad river upon their left , while before they have only see the stream which flow into it . on the second occasion he point to where , on the farther side , they could see dark shadow flit over the water . " iroquois canoe , " he whisper . " there be ten of them with eight man in each . they be another party , and they be also go north . " " how do you know that they be another party ? " " because we have cross the trail of the first within the hour . " be fill with amazement at this marvellous man who could hear in his sleep and could detect a trail when the very be invisible to ordinary eye . halt a little to watch the canoe , and then turn his back to the river , and plunge into the wood once more . they have go a mile or two when suddenly he come to a dead stop , snuff at the air like a hound on a scent . " i smell burning wood , " say he . " there be a fire within a mile of us in that direction . " " i smell it too , " say . " let us creep up that way and see their camp . " " be careful , then , " whisper , " for your life may hang from a crack twig . " they advance very slowly and cautiously until suddenly the red flare of a leap fire twinkle between the distant trunk . still slip through the brushwood , they work round until they have find a point from which they could see without a risk of be see . a great blaze of dry log crackle and in the centre of a small clearing . the ruddy flame roar upwards , and the smoke spread out above it until it look like a strange tree with gray foliage and trunk of fire . but no living being be in sight and the huge fire roar and sway in absolute solitude in the midst of the silent woodland . near they creep and near , but there be no movement save the rush of the flame , and no sound but the snap of the stick . " shall we go up to it ? " whisper . the wary old pioneer shake his head . " it may be a trap , " say he . " or an abandon camp ? " " no , it have not be light more than an hour . " " besides , it be far too great for a camp fire , " say . " what do you make of it ? " ask . " a signal . " " yes , i that you be right . this light be not a safe neighbour , so we shall edge away from it and then make a straight line for . " the flame be soon but a twinkle point behind them , and at last vanish behind the tree . push on rapidly until they come to the edge of a moonlit clearing . he be about to skirt this , as he have do other , when suddenly he catch by the shoulder and push him down behind a clump of sumach , while do the same with . a man be walk down the other side of the open space . he have just emerge , and be cross it diagonally , make in the direction of the river . his body be bend double , but as he come out from the shadow of the tree they could see that he be an indian brave in full war-paint , with leggings , loin-cloth , and musket . close at his heel come a second , and then a third and a fourth , on and on until it seem as if the wood be full of man , and that the line would never come to an end . they flit past like shadow in the moonlight , in absolute silence , all crouch and run in the same swift stealthy fashion . last of all come a man in the fringe tunic of a hunter , with a cap and feather upon his head . he pass across like the other , and they vanish into the shadow as silently as they have appear . it be five minute before think it safe to rise from their shelter . " by , " he whisper , " do you count them ? " " three hundred and , " say . " i make it four hundred and two . " " and you think that there be only a hundred and fifty of them ! " cry . " ah , you do not understand . this be a fresh band . the other who take the blockhouse must be over there , for their trail lie between us and the river . " " they could not be the same , " say , " for there be not a fresh scalp among them . " give the young hunter a glance of approval . " on my word , " say he , " i do not know that your woodsman be as good as they seem to be . you have eye , monsieur , and it may please you some day to remember that tell you so . " feel a flush of pride at these word from a man whose name be honour wherever trader or trapper smoke round a camp fire . he be about to make some answer when a dreadful cry break suddenly out of the wood , a horrible screech , as from some one who be goad to the very last pitch of human misery . again and again , as they stand with blanch cheek in the darkness , they hear that awful cry swell up from the night and ring drearily through the forest . " they be torture the woman , " say . " their camp lie over there . " " can we do nothing to aid them ? " cry . " ay , ay , lad , " say the captain in . " we ca n't pass distress signal without go out of our course . let us put about and run down yonder . " " in that camp , " say slowly , " there be now nearly six hundred warrior . we be four . what you say have no sense . unless we warn them at , these devil will lay some trap for them . their party be assemble by land and by water , and there may be a thousand before daybreak . our duty be to push on and give our warning . " " he speak the truth , " say to . " nay , but you must not go alone ! " he seize the stout old seaman by the arm and hold him by main force to prevent him from break off through the wood . " there be one thing which we can do to spoil their night 's amusement , " say . " the wood be as dry as powder , and there have be no drop of rain for a long three month . " " yes ? " " and the wind blow straight for their camp , with the river on the other side of it . " " we should fire the wood ! " " we can do well . " in an instant have scrape together a little bundle of dry twig , and have heap them up against a wither beech tree which be as dry as tinder . a stroke of flint and steel be enough to start a little smoulder of flame , which lengthen and spread until it be leap along the white strip of hang bark . a quarter of a mile farther on do the same again , and once more beyond that , until at three different point the forest be in a blaze . as they hurry onwards they could hear the dull roaring of the flame behind them , and at last , as they near , they could see , look back , the long rolling wave of fire travel ever westward towards the , and flash up into great spout of flame as it lick up a clump of pine as if it be a bundle of faggot . chuckle in his silent way as he look back at the long orange glare in the sky . " they will need to swim for it , some of them , " say he . " they have not canoe to take them all off . ah , if i have but two hundred of my on the river at the farther side of them not one would have get away . " " they have one who be dress like a white man , " remark . " ay , and the most deadly of the lot . his father be a dutch trader , his mother an iroquois , and he go by the name of the flemish . ah , i know him well , and i tell you that if they want a king in hell , they will find one all ready in his wigwam . by , i have a score to settle with him , and i may pay it before this business be over . well , there be the light of shine down below there . i can understand that sigh of relief , monsieur , for , on my word , after what we find at , i be uneasy myself until i should see them . " day be just break as the four comrade enter the gate of the stockade , but early as it be the and their family be all afoot stare at the prodigious fire which rage to the south of them . burst through the throng and rush upstairs to , who have herself flow down to meet him , so that they meet in each other 's arm half-way up the great stone staircase with a burst of those little inarticulate cry which be the true unwritten language of love . together , with his arm round her , they ascend to the great hall where old with his son be peer out of the window at the wonderful spectacle . " ah , monsieur , " say the old nobleman , with his courtly bow , " i be indeed rejoice to see you safe under my roof again , not only for your own sake , but for that of madame 's eye , which , if she will permit an old man to say so , be much too pretty to spoil by strain them all day in the hope of see some one come out of the forest . you have do forty mile , monsieur , and be doubtless hungry and weary . when you be yourself again i must claim my revenge in piquet , for the card lay against me the other night . " but have enter at 's heel with his tidings of disaster . " you will have another game to play , monsieur , " say he . " there be six hundred in the wood and they be prepare to attack . " " tut , tut , we can allow our arrangement to be alter by a handful of savage , " say the seigneur . " i must apologise to you , my dear , that you should be annoy by such people while you be upon my estate . as regard the piquet , i can but think that your play from king and knave be more brilliant than safe . now when i play piquet last with of -- " " of be dead , and all his people , " say . " the blockhouse be a heap of smoking ash . " the seigneur raise his eyebrow and take a pinch of snuff , tap the lid of his little round gold box . " i always tell him that his fort would be take unless he clear away those maple tree which grow up to the very wall . they be all dead , you say ? " " every man . " " and the fort burn ? " " not a stick be leave standing . " " have you see these rascal ? " " we see the trail of a hundred and fifty . then there be a hundred in canoe , and a of four hundred pass us under the flemish . their camp be five mile down the river , and there can be less than six hundred . " " you be fortunate in escape them . " " but they be not so fortunate in escape us . we kill and his son , and we fire the wood so as to drive them out of their camp . " " excellent ! excellent ! " say the seigneur , clap gently with his dainty hand . " you have do very well indeed , ! you be , i presume , very tired ? " " i be not often tired . i be quite ready to do the journey again . " " then perhaps you would pick a few man and go back into the wood to see what these villain be do ? " " i shall be ready in five minute . " " perhaps you would like to go also , ? " his son 's dark eye and indian face light up with a fierce joy . " yes , i shall go also , " he answer . " very good , and we shall make all ready in your absence . madame , you will excuse these little annoyance which mar the pleasure of your visit . next time that you do me the honour to come here i trust that we shall have clear all these vermin from my estate . we have our advantage . the be a good fish pond , and these forest be a fine deer preserve than any of which the king can boast . but on the other hand we have , as you see , our little trouble . you will excuse me now , as there be one or two thing which demand my attention . , you be a try soldier and i should be glad of your advice . , give me my lace handkerchief and my cane of clouded amber , and take care of madame until her husband and i return . " it be bright daylight now , and the square enclosure within the stockade be fill with an anxious crowd who have just learn the evil tidings . most of the be old soldier and trapper who have serve in many indian war , and whose swarthy face and bold bearing tell their own story . they be son of a race which with good fortune or with bad have burn more powder than any other nation upon earth , and as they stand in little group discuss the situation and examine their arm , a leader could have ask for no more hardy or more following . the woman , however , pale and breathless , be hurry in from the outlying cottage , drag their child with them , and bear over their shoulder the more precious of their household good . the confusion , the hurry , the cry of the child , the throw down of bundle and the rush back for more , contrast sharply with the quiet and the beauty of the wood which encircle them , all bath in the bright morning sunlight . it be strange to look upon the fairy loveliness of their foliage , and to know that the spirit of murder and cruelty be roam unchain behind that lovely screen . the scout party under and have already leave , and at the order of the seigneur the two gate be now secure with huge bar of oak fit into iron staple on either side . the child be place in the low with a few woman to watch them , while the other be tell off to attend to the fire bucket , and to the musket . the man have be parade , of them in all , and they be divide into party now for the defence of each part of the stockade . on one side it have be build up to within a few yard of the river , which not only relieve them from the defence of that face , but enable them to get fresh water by throw a bucket at the end of a rope from the stockade . the boat and canoe of be draw up on the bank just under the wall , and be precious now as offer a last means of escape should all else fail . the next fort , , be but a few league up the river , and have already send a swift messenger to them with news of the danger . at least it would be a point on which they might retreat should the bad come to the bad . and that the bad might come to the bad be very evident to so experience a woodsman as . he have leave snore in a deep sleep upon the floor , and be now walk round the defence with his pipe in his mouth , examine with a critical eye every detail in connection with them . the stockade be very strong , nine foot high and closely build of oak stake which be thick enough to turn a bullet . half-way up it be in long narrow slit for the fire of the defender . but on the other hand the tree grow up to within a hundred yard of it , and form a screen for the attack , while the garrison be so scanty that it could not spare more than twenty man at the utmost for each face . know how daring and dashing be the iroquois warrior , how cunning and fertile of resource , and his face darken as he think of the young wife who have come so far in their safe-keeping , and of the woman and child whom he have see crowd into the fort . " would it not be good if you could send them up the river ? " he suggest to the seigneur . " i should very gladly do so , monsieur , and perhaps if we be all alive we may manage it if the weather should be cloudy . but i can spare the man to guard them , and i can send them without a guard when we know that iroquois canoe be on the river and their scout be swarm on the bank . " " you be right . it would be madness . " " i have station you on this eastern face with your friend and with fifteen man . monsieur , will you command the party ? " " willingly . " " i will take the south face as it seem to be the point of danger . can take the north , and five man should be enough to watch the river side . " " have we food and powder ? " " i have flour and smoke eel enough to see this matter through . poor fare , my dear sir , but i you learn in that a cup of ditch water after a brush may have a good smack than the which you help me to finish the other night . as to powder , we have all our trading store to draw upon . " " we have not time to clear any of these tree ? " ask the soldier . " impossible . they would make good shelter down than up . " " but at least i might clear that patch of brushwood round the birch sapling which lie between the east face and the edge of the forest . it be good cover for their skirmisher . " " yes , that should be fire without delay . " " nay , i think that i might do good , " say . " we might bait a trap for them there . where be this powder of which you speak ? " " , the major-domo , be give out powder in the main store-house . " " very good . " vanish upstairs , and return with a large linen bag in his hand . this he fill with powder , and then , sling it over his shoulder , he carry it out to the clump of bush and place it at the base of the sapling , cut a strip out of the bark immediately above the spot . then with a few leafy branch and fall leave he cover the powder bag very carefully over so that it look like a little hillock of earth . have arrange all to his satisfaction he return , clamber over the stockade , and drop down upon the other side . " i think that we be all ready for them now , " say the seigneur . " i would that the woman and child be in a safe place , but we may send them down the river if all go well . have anyone hear anything of ? " " have the good ear of any of us , your excellency , " say one man from beside the brass corner cannon . " he think that he hear shot a few minute ago . " " then he have come into touch with them . , take ten man and go to the wither oak to cover them if they be retreat , but do not go another yard on any pretext . i be too short-handed already . perhaps , , you wish to sleep ? " " no , i could not sleep . " " we can do no more down here . what do you say to a round or two of piquet ? a little turn of the card will help us to pass the time . " they ascend to the upper hall , where come and sit by her husband , while the swarthy crouch by the window look keenly out into the forest . have little think to spare upon the card , as his mind wander to the danger which threaten them and to the woman whose hand rest upon his own . the old nobleman , on the other hand , be engross by the play , and curse under his breath , or chuckle and grin as the luck sway one way or the other . suddenly as they play there come two sharp rap from without . " some one be tap , " cry . " it be death that be tap , " say the indian woman at the window . " ay , ay , it be the patter of two spend ball against the woodwork . the wind be against our hearing the report . the card be shuffle . it be my cut and your deal . the , i think , be mine . " " man be rush from the wood , " cry . " tut ! it grow serious ! " say the nobleman . " we can finish the game later . remember that the deal lie with you . let us see what it all mean . " have already rush to the window . , young de la , and eight of the cover party be run with their head bend towards the stockade , the door of which have be open to admit them . here and there from behind the tree come little blue puff of smoke , and one of the fugitive who wear white calico breech begin suddenly to hop instead of run and a red splotch show upon the white cloth . two other throw their arm round him and the three rush in abreast while the gate swing into its place behind them . an instant later the brass cannon at the corner give a flash and a roar while the whole outline of the wood be trace in a rolling cloud , and the shower of bullet rap up against the wooden wall like sleet on a window . have leave to the care of her indian hostess , and warn her for her life to keep from the window , seize his musket and rush downstairs . as he pass a bullet come pipe through one of the narrow embrasure and star itself in a little blotch of lead upon the opposite wall . the seigneur have already descend and be converse with beside the door . " a thousand of them , you say ? " " yes , we come on a fresh trail of a large , three hundred at the least . they be all mohawk and with a sprinkling of . we have a run fight for a few mile , and we have lose five man . " " all dead , i trust . " " i hope so , but we be hard press to keep from be cut off . be shoot through the leg . " " i see that he be hit . " " we have well have all ready to retire to the house if they carry the stockade . we can scarce hope to hold it when they be twenty to one . " " all be ready . " " and with our cannon we can keep their canoe from pass , so we might send our woman away . " " i have intend to do so . will you take charge of the north side ? you might come across to me with ten of your man now , and i shall go back to you if they change their attack . " the firing come in one continuous rattle now from the edge of the wood , and the air be full of bullet . the assailant be all train shot , man who live by their gun , and to whom a shake hand or a dim eye mean poverty and hunger . every slit and crack and be mark , and a cap hold above the stockade be blow in an instant from the gun barrel which support it . on the other hand , the defender be also skilled in indian fighting , and wise in every trick and lure which could protect themselves or tempt their enemy to show . they keep well to the side of the , watch through little crevice of the wood , and fire swiftly when a chance offer . a red leg stick straight up into the air from behind a log show where one bullet at least have go home , but there be little to aim at save a puff and flash from among the leave , or the shadowy figure of a warrior see for an instant as he dart from one tree-trunk to the other . seven of the canadian have already be hit , but only three be mortally wound , and the other four still keep manfully to their , though one who have be strike through the jaw be spit his tooth with his bullet down into his . the woman sit in a line upon the ground , beneath the level of the , each with a of bullet and a canister of powder , pass up the loaded gun to the fight man at the point where a quick fire be most needful . at first the attack have be all upon the south face , but as fresh body of the come up their line spread and lengthen until the whole east face be gird with fire , which gradually envelop the north also . the fort be ringed in by a great loop of smoke , save only where the broad river flow past them . over near the further bank the canoe be lurk , and one , man by ten warrior , attempt to pass up the stream , but a good shot from the brass gun dash in her side and sink her , while a second of grape leave only four of the swimmer whose high stand out above the water like the of some strange fish . on the inland side , however , the seigneur have order the cannon to be serve no more , for the broad embrasure draw the enemy 's fire , and of the man who have be strike half be among those who work the gun . the old nobleman strut about with his white ruffle and his clouded cane behind the line of parched man , tap his snuff-box , shoot out his little jest , and look very much less concerned than he have do over his piquet . " what do you think of it , ? " he ask . " i think very badly of it . we be lose man much too fast . " " well , my friend , what can you expect ? when a thousand musket be all turn upon a little place like this , some one must suffer for it . ah , my poor fellow , so you be do for too ! " the man nearest him have suddenly fall with a crash , lie quite still with his face in a platter of the which have be bring out by the woman . glance at him and then look round . " he be in a line with no , and it take him in the shoulder , " say he . " where do it come from then ? ah , by , look there ! " he point upwards to a little mist of smoke which hang round the summit of a high oak . " the rascal overlook the stockade . but the trunk be hardly thick enough to shield him at that height . this poor fellow will not need his musket again , and i see that it be ready prime . " de la lay down his cane , turn back his ruffle , pick up the dead man 's gun , and fire at the lurk warrior . two leave flutter out from the tree and a grin vermilion face appear for an instant with a yell of derision . quick as a flash bring his musket to his shoulder and pull the trigger . the man give a tremendous spring and crash down through the thick foliage . some seventy or eighty foot below him a single stout branch shoot out , and on to this he fall with the sound of a great stone drop into a bog , and hang there double over it , swing slowly from side to side like a red rag , his stream down between his foot . a shout of exultation rise from the canadian at the sight , which be drown in the murderous yell of the savage . " his limb twitch . he be not dead , " cry . " let him die there , " say the old pioneer callously , ram a fresh charge into his gun . " ah , there be the gray hat again . it come ever when i be unload . " " i see a plume hat among the brushwood . " " it be the flemish . i have rather have his scalp than those of his hundred good warrior . " " be he so brave then ? " " yes , he be brave enough . there be no deny it , for how else could he be an iroquois ? but he be clever and cunning , and -- ah , my , if all the storey tell be true , his cruelty be past believe . i should fear that my tongue would wither if i do but name the thing which this man have do . ah , he be there again . " the gray hat with the plume have show itself once more in a rift of the smoke . de la and both fire together , and the cap flutter up into the air . at the same instant the bush part , and a tall warrior spring out into full view of the defender . his face be that of an indian , but a shade or two light , and a pointed black beard hang down over his hunting tunic . he throw out his hand with a gesture of disdain , stand for an instant look steadfastly at the fort , and then spring back into cover amid a shower of bullet which chip away the twig all round him . " yes , he be brave enough , " repeat with an oath . " your have have their hoe in their hand more often than their musket , i should judge from their shooting . but they seem to be draw closer upon the east face , and i think that they will make a rush there before long . " the fire have indeed grow very much fierce upon the side which be defend by , and it be plain that the main force of the be gather at that point . from every log , and trunk , and cleft , and bush come the red flash with the gray halo , and the bullet sing in a continuous stream through the . have whittle a little hole for himself about a foot above the ground , and lay upon his face loading and firing in his own quiet methodical fashion . beside him stand , his mouth set grimly , his eye flash from under his brow , and his whole soul absorb in the smite of the . his hat be go , his grizzled hair fly in the breeze , great splotch of powder mottle his mahogany face , and a weal across his right cheek show where an indian bullet have graze him . be bear himself like an experienced soldier , walk up and down among his man with short word of praise or of precept , those rough and blunt which bring a glow to the heart and a flush to the cheek . seven of his man be down , but as the attack grow fierce upon his side it slacken upon the other , and the seigneur with his son and bring ten man to reinforce them . de la be hold out his snuff-box to when a shrill scream from behind them make them both look round . , the indian wife , be wring her hand over the body of her son . a glance show that the bullet have pierce his heart and that he be dead . for an instant the old nobleman 's thin face grow a shade pale , and the hand which hold out the little gold box shake like a branch in the wind . then he thrust it into his pocket again and master the spasm which have convulse his feature . " the always die upon the field of honour , " he remark . " i think that we should have some more man in the angle by the gun . " and now it become clear why it be that the have choose the eastern face for their main attack . it be there that the clump of cover lie midway between the edge of the forest and the stockade . a storm party could creep as far as that and gather there for the final rush . one crouch warrior , and then a second , and then a third dart across the little belt of open space , and throw themselves down among the bush . the fourth be hit , and lie with his back break a few pace out from the edge of the wood , but a stream of warrior continue to venture the passage , until have get across , and the little patch of underwood be full of lurk savage . 's time have come . from where he lie he could see the white patch where he have cut the bark from the birch sapling , and he know that immediately underneath it lie the powder bag . he sight the mark , and then slowly lower his barrel until he have get to the base of the little tree as nearly as he could guess it among the tangle of bush . the first shot produce no result , however , and the second be aim a foot lower . the bullet penetrate the bag , and there be an explosion which shake the manor-house and sway the whole line of stout stockade as though they be in a breeze . up to the high summit of the tree go the huge column of blue smoke , and after the first roar there be a deathly silence which be break by the patter and thud of fall body . then come a wild cheer from the defender , and a furious answering whoop from the , while the fire from the wood burst out with great fury than ever . but the blow have be a heavy one . of the warrior , all pick for their valour , only four regain the shelter of the wood , and those so tear and shatter that they be spend man . already the have lose heavily , and this fresh disaster make them reconsider their plan of attack , for the be as wary as they be brave , and he be esteem the good who be most chary of the life of his follower . their fire gradually slacken , and at last , save for a drop shot here and there , it die away altogether . " be it possible that they be go to abandon the attack ? " cry joyously . " , i believe that you have save us . " but the wily shake his head . " a wolf would as soon leave a bone as an iroquois such a prise as this . " " but they have lose heavily . " " ay , but not so heavily as ourselves in proportion to our number . they have fifty out of a thousand , and we twenty out of threescore . no , no , they be hold a council , and we shall soon hear from them again . but it may be some hour first , and if you will take my advice you will have an hour 's sleep , for you be not , as i can see by your eye , as use to do without it as i be , and there may be little rest for any of us this night . " be indeed weary to the last pitch of human endurance . and the seaman have already wrap themselves in their blanket and sink to sleep under the shelter of the stockade . the soldier rush upstairs to say a few word of comfort to the tremble , and then throw himself down upon a couch he sleep the dreamless sleep of an exhaust man . when at last he be rouse by a fresh sputter of musketry fire from the wood the sun be already low in the heaven , and the mellow light of evening ting the bare wall of the room . he spring from his couch , seize his musket , and rush downstairs . the defender be gather at their once more , while , the seigneur , and be whisper eagerly together . he notice as he pass that still sit croon by the body of her son , without have change her position since morning . " what be it , then ? be they come on ? " he ask . " they be up to some devilry , " say , peer out at the corner of the embrasure . " they be gather thickly at the east fringe , and yet the firing come from the south . it be not the indian way to attack across the open , and yet if they think help be come from the fort they might venture it . " " the wood in front of us be alive with them , " say . " they be as busy as beaver among the underwood . " " perhaps they be go to attack from this side , and cover the attack by a fire from the flank . " " that be what i think , " cry the seigneur . " bring the spare gun up here and all the man except five for each side . " the word be hardly out of his mouth when a shrill yell burst from the wood , and in an instant a cloud of warrior dash out and charge across the open , howl , spring , and wave their gun or tomahawk in the air . with their painted face , smear and stripe with every vivid colour , their stream , their wave arm , their open mouth , and their and contortion , no more fiendish crew ever burst into a sleeper 's nightmare . some of those in front bore canoe between them , and as they reach the stockade they plant them against it and swarm up them as if they have be scaling-ladder . other fire through the embrasure and , the muzzle of their musket touch those of the defender , while other again spring unaided on to the top of the palisade and jump fearlessly down upon the inner side . the canadian , however , make such a resistance as might be expect from man who know that no mercy await them . they fire whilst they have time to load , and then , club their musket , they smash furiously at every red head which show above the rail . the din within the stockade be infernal , the shout and cry of the french , the whooping of the savage , and the terrify scream of the frightened woman blend into one dreadful uproar , above which could be hear the high shrill voice of the old seigneur implore his to stand fast . with his rapier in his hand , his hat lose , his wig awry , and his dignity all throw to the wind , the old nobleman show them that day how a soldier of could carry himself , and with , , and , be ever in the forefront of the defence . so desperately do they fight , the sword and outreach the tomahawk , that though at one time fifty be over the palisade , they have slay or drive back nearly all of them when a fresh wave burst suddenly over the south face which have be strip of its defender . see in an instant that the enclosure be lose and that only one thing could save the house . " hold them for an instant , " he scream , and rush at the brass gun he strike his flint and steel and fire it straight into the thick of the savage . then as they recoil for an instant he stick a nail into the and drive it home with a blow from the butt of his gun . dart across the yard he spike the gun at the other corner , and be back at the door as the remnant of the garrison be hurl towards it by the rush of the assailant . the canadian dart in , and swing the ponderous mass of wood into position , break the leg of the foremost warrior who have strive to follow them . then for an instant they have time for breathing and for council . but their case be a very evil one . have the gun be lose so that they might be turn upon the door , all further resistance would have be vain , but 's presence of mind have save them from that danger . the two gun upon the river face and the canoe be safe , for they be command by the window of the house . but their number be terribly reduce , and those who be leave be weary and wound and spend . nineteen have gain the house , but one have be shoot through the body and lay groan in the hall , while a second have his shoulder cleave by a tomahawk and could no longer raise his musket . , , and be , but have a in his forearm , and be bleed from a cut upon the face . of the other hardly one be without injury , and yet they have no time to think of their hurt for the danger still press and they be lose unless they act . a few shot from the barricade window suffice to clear the enclosure , for it be all expose to their aim ; but on the other hand they have the shelter of the stockade now , and from the further side of it they keep up a fierce fire upon the window . half-a-dozen of the return the fusillade , while the leader consult as to what have well be do . " we have woman and fourteen child , " say the seigneur . " i be sure that you will agree with me , gentleman , that our first duty be towards them . some of you , like myself , have lose son or brother this day . let us at least save our wife and sister . " " no iroquois canoe have pass up the river , " say one of the canadian . " if the woman start in the darkness they can get away to the fort . " " by of , " exclaim , " i think it would be well if you could get your man out of this also , for i can see how it be to be hold until morning . " a murmur of assent break from the other canadian , but the old nobleman shake his head with decision . " tut ! tut ! what nonsense be this ! " he cry . " be we to abandon the manor-house of to the first gang of savage who choose to make an attack upon it ? no , no , gentleman , there be still nearly a score of us , and when the garrison learn that we be so press , which will be by morning at the late , they will certainly send us relief . " shake his head moodily . " if you stand by the fort i will not desert you , " say he , " and yet it be a pity to sacrifice brave man for nothing . " " the canoe will hardly hold the woman and child as it be , " cry . " there be but two large and four small . there be not space for a single man . " " then that decide it , " say . " but who be to row the woman ? " " it be but a few league with the current in their favour , and there be none of our woman who do not know how to handle a paddle . " the be very quiet now , and an occasional drop shot from the tree or the stockade be the only sign of their presence . their loss have be heavy , and they be either engage in collect their dead , or in hold a council as to their next move . the twilight be gather in , and the sun have already sink beneath the . leave a watchman at each window , the leader go round to the back of the house where the canoe be lie upon the bank . there be no sign of the enemy upon the river to the north of them . " we be in luck , " say . " the cloud be gather and there will be little light . " " it be luck indeed , since the moon be only three day past the full , " answer . " i wonder that the have not cut us off upon the water , but it be likely that their canoe have go south to bring up another . they may be back soon , and we have well not lose a moment . " " in an hour it might be dark enough to start . " " i think that there be rain in those cloud , and that will make it dark still . " the woman and child be assemble and their place in each boat be assign to them . the wife of the , rough hardy woman whose life have be spend under the shadow of a constant danger , be for the most part quiet and collect , though a few of the young one whimper a little . a woman be always brave when she have a child to draw her thought from herself , and each married woman have one now allot to her as her own special charge until they should reach the fort . to , the indian wife of the seigneur , who be as wary and as experience as a war sachem of her people , the command of the woman be entrust . " it be not very far , , " say , as his wife cling to his arm . " you remember how we hear the bell as we journey through the wood . that be , and it be but a league or two . " " but i do not wish to leave you , . we have be together in all our trouble . oh , , why should we be divide now ? " " my dear love , you will tell them at the fort how thing be with us , and they will bring us help . " " let the other do that , and i will stay . i will not be useless , . have teach me to load a gun . i will not be afraid , indeed i will not , if you will only let me stay . " " you must not ask it , . it be impossible , child i could not let you stay . " " but i feel so sure that it would be well . " the coarse reason of man have not yet learn to value those subtle instinct which guide a woman . argue and exhort until he have silence if he have not convince her . " it be for my sake , dear . you do not know what a load it will be from my heart when i know that you be safe . and you need not be afraid for me . we can easily hold the place until morning . then the people from the fort will come , for i hear that they have plenty of canoe , and we shall all meet again . " be silent , but her hand tighten upon his arm . her husband be still endeavour to reassure her when a groan burst from the watcher at the window which overlook the stream . " there be a canoe on the river to the north of us , " he cry . the besiege look at each other in dismay . the have then cut off their retreat after all . " how many warrior be in it ? " ask the seigneur . " i can see . the light be not very good , and it be in the shadow of the bank . " " which way be it come ? " " it be come this way . ah , it shoot out into the open now , and i can see it . may the good be praise ! a dozen candle shall burn in if i live till next summer ! " " what be it then ? " cry impatiently . " it be not an iroquois canoe . there be but one man in it . he be a canadian . " " a canadian ! " cry , spring up to the window . " who but a madman would venture into such a hornet 's nest alone ! ah , yes , i can see him now . he keep well out from the bank to avoid their fire . now he be in and he turn towards us . by my faith , it be not the first time that the good father have handle a paddle . " " it be a jesuit ! " say one , crane his neck . " they be ever where there be most danger . " " no , i can see his capote , " cry another . " it be a franciscan friar ! " an instant later there be the sound of a canoe ground upon the pebble , the door be unbar , and a man stride in , attire in the long brown gown of the franciscan . he cast a rapid glance around , and then , step up to , lay his hand upon his shoulder . " so , you have not escape me ! " say he . " we have catch the evil seed before it have have time to root . " " what do you mean , father ? " ask the seigneur . " you have make some mistake . this be my good friend , of a noble french family . " " this be , the heretic and huguenot , " cry the monk . " i have follow him up the , and i have follow him up the , and i would have follow him to the world 's end if i could but bring him back with me . " " tut , father , your zeal carry you too far , " say the seigneur . " whither would you take my friend , then ? " " he shall go back to with his wife . there be no place in for heretic . " burst out laugh . " by , father , " say he , " if you could take us all back to at present we should be very much your debtor . " " and you will remember , " say sternly , " that you be under my roof and that you be speak of my guest . " but the friar be not to be abash by the frown of the old nobleman . " look at this , " say he , whip a paper out of his bosom . " it be sign by the governor , and call upon you , under pain of the king 's displeasure , to return this man to . ah , monsieur , when you leave me upon the island that morning you little think that i would return to for this , and then hunt you down so many hundred of mile of river . but i have you now , and i shall never leave you until i see you on board the ship which will carry you and your wife back to . " for all the bitter vindictiveness which gleam in the monk 's eye , could not but admire the energy and tenacity of the man . " it seem to me , father , that you would have shine more as a soldier than as a follower of , " say he ; " but , since you have follow us here , and since there be no get away , we may settle this question at some late time . " but the two be less incline to take so peaceful a view . 's beard bristle with anger , and he whisper something into 's ear . " the captain and i could easily get rid of him , " say the young woodsman , draw aside . " if he will cross our path he must pay for it . " " no , no , not for the world , ! let him alone . he do what he think to be his duty , though his faith be strong than his charity , i think . but here come the rain , and surely it be dark enough now for the boat . " a great brown cloud have the heaven , and the night have fall so rapidly that they could hardly see the gleam of the river in front of them . the savage in the wood and behind the capture stockade be quiet , save for an occasional shot , but the yell and whoop from the cottage of the show that they be be plunder by their captor . suddenly a dull red glow begin to show above one of the roof . " they have set it on fire , " cry . " the canoe must go at once , for the river will soon be as light as day . in ! in ! there be not an instant to lose ! " there be no time for leave-taking . one impassioned kiss and be tear away and thrust into the small canoe , which she share with , two child , and an unmarried girl . the other rush into their place , and in a few moment they have push off , and have vanish into the drift and the darkness . the great cloud have break and the rain patter heavily upon the roof , and splash upon their face as they strain their eye after the vanish boat . " thank for this storm ! " murmur . " it will prevent the cottage from blaze up too quickly . " but he have forget that though the roof might be wet the interior be as dry as tinder . he have hardly speak before a great yellow tongue of flame lick out of one of the window , and again and again , until suddenly half of the roof fall in , and the cottage be blaze like a . the flame hiss and sputter in the pour rain , but , feed from below , they grow still high and fierce , flash upon the great tree , and turn their trunk to burnish brass . their light make the enclosure and the manor-house as clear as day , and expose the whole long stretch of the river . a fearful yell from the wood announce that the savage have see the canoe , which be plainly visible from the window not more than a quarter of a mile away . " they be rush through the wood . they be make for the water 's edge , " cry . " they have some canoe down there , " say . " but they must pass us ! " cry the of . " get down to the cannon and see if you can stop them . " they have hardly reach the gun when two large canoe fill with warrior shoot out from among the reed below the fort , and steer out into begin to paddle furiously after the fugitive . " , you be our good shot , " cry . " lay for her as she pass the great pine tree . , do you take the other gun . the life of all whom you love may hang upon the shot ! " the two wrinkle old artilleryman glance along their gun and wait for the canoe to come abreast of them . the fire still blaze high and high , and the broad river lie like a sheet of dull metal with two dark line , which mark the canoe , sweep swiftly down the centre . one be fifty yard in front of the other , but in each the be bend to their paddle and pull frantically , while their comrade from the wooded shore whoop them on to fresh exertion . the fugitive have already disappear round the bend of the river . as the first canoe come abreast of the low of the two gun , the make the sign of the cross over the and fire . a cheer and then a groan go up from the eager watcher . the discharge have strike the surface close to the mark , and dash such a shower of water over it that for an instant it look as if it have be sink . the next moment , however , the splash subside , and the canoe shoot away , save that one of the rower have drop his paddle while his head fall forward upon the back of the man in front of him . the second gunner sight the same canoe as it come abreast of him , but at the very instant when he stretch out his match to fire a bullet come hum from the stockade and he fall forward dead without a groan . " this be work that i know something of , lad , " say old , spring suddenly forward . " but when i fire a gun i like to train it myself . give me a help with the handspike and get her straight for the island . so ! a little low for an even keel ! now we have them ! " he clap down his match and fire . it be a beautiful shot . the whole charge take the canoe about six foot behind the bow , and double her up like an eggshell . before the smoke have clear she have founder , and the second canoe have pause to pick up some of the wounded man . the other , as much at home in the water as in the wood , be already strike out for the shore . " quick ! quick ! " cry the seigneur . " load the gun ! we may get the second one yet ! " but it be not to be . long before they could get it ready the have pick up their wounded warrior and be pull madly once more . as they shoot away the fire die suddenly down in the burning cottage and the rain and the darkness close in upon them . " ! " cry furiously , " they will be take . let us abandon this place , take a boat , and follow them . come ! come ! not an instant be to be lose ! " " monsieur , you go too far in your very natural anxiety , " say the seigneur coldly . " i be not incline to leave my post so easily ! " " ah , what be it ? only wood and stone , which can be build again . but to think of the woman in the hand of these devil ! oh , i be go mad ! come ! come ! for 's sake come ! " his face be deadly pale , and he rave with his clench hand in the air . " i do not think that they will be catch , " say , lay his hand soothingly upon his shoulder . " do not fear . they have a long start and the woman here can paddle as well as the man . again , the iroquois canoe be overload at the start , and have the wounded man aboard as well now . besides , these oak canoe of the mohawk be not as swift as the algonquin birch bark which we use . in any case it be impossible to follow , for we have no boat . " " there be one lie there . " " ah , it will but hold a single man . it be that in which the friar come . " " then i be go in that ! my place be with ! " he fling open the door , rush out , and be about to push off the frail skiff , when some one spring past him , and with a blow from a hatchet stove in the side of the boat . " it be my boat , " say the friar , throw down the axe and fold his arm . " i can do what i like with it . " " you fiend ! you have ruin us ! " " i have find you and you shall not escape me again . " the hot blood flush to the soldier 's head , and pick up the axe , he take a quick step forward . the light from the open door shine upon the grave , harsh face of the friar , but not a muscle twitch nor a feature change as he see the axe whirl up in the hand of a furious man . he only sign himself with the cross , and mutter a latin prayer under his breath . it be that composure which save his life . hurl down the axe again with a bitter curse , and be turn away from the shattered boat , when in an instant , without a warning , the great door of the manor-house crash inwards , and a flood of whooping savage burst into the house . what have occur be easily explain . the watcher in the window at the front find that it be more than flesh and blood could endure to remain wait at their post while the fate of their wife and child be be decide at the back . all be quiet at the stockade , and the appear to be as absorb as the canadian in what be pass upon the river . one by one , therefore , the man on guard have creep away and have assemble at the back to cheer the seaman 's shot and to groan as the remain canoe speed like a bloodhound down the river in the wake of the fugitive . but the savage have one at their head who be as full of wile and resource as himself . the flemish have watch the house from behind the stockade as a dog watch a , and he have instantly discover that the defender have leave their post . with a score of other warrior he raise a great log from the edge of the forest , and cross the open space unchallenged , he and his man rush it against the door with such violence as to crack the bar across and tear the wood from the hinge . the first intimation which the survivor have of the attack be the crash of the door , and the scream of two of the negligent watchman who have be seize and scalp in the hall . the whole basement floor be in the hand of the , and and his enemy the friar be cut off from the foot of the stair . fortunately , however , the manor-house of be build with the one idea of defence against , and even now there be hope for the defender . a wooden ladder which could be draw up in case of need hang down from the upper window to the ground upon the . rush round to this , follow by the friar . he feel about for the ladder in the darkness . it be go . then indeed his heart sink in despair . where could he fly to ? the boat be destroy . the stockade lay between him and the forest , and they be in the hand of the . their yell be ring in his ear . they have not see him yet , but in a few minute they must come upon him . suddenly he hear a voice from somewhere in the darkness above him . " give me your gun , lad , " it say . " i see the loom of some of the heathen down by the wall . " " it be i. it be i , , " cry . " down with the ladder or i be a dead man . " " have a care . it may be a ruse , " say the voice of . " no , no , i will answer for it , " cry , and an instant later down come the ladder . and the friar rush up it , and they hardly have their foot upon the rung when a swarm of warrior burst out from the door and pour along the river bank . two musket flash from above , something plop like a salmon in the water , and next instant the two be among their comrade and the ladder have be draw up once more . but it be a very small band who now hold the last point to which they could retreat . only nine of them remain , the seigneur , , the two , the friar , , the major-domo , and two of the . wounded , parched , and , they be still fill with the mad courage of desperate man who know that death could come in no more terrible form than through surrender . the stone staircase run straight up from the kitchen to the main hall , and the door , which have be barricade across the low part by two mattress , command the whole flight . hoarse and the click of the cock of gun from below tell that the be muster for a rush . " put the lantern by the door , " say , " so that it may throw the light upon the stair . there be only room for three to fire , but you can all load and pass the gun . monsieur green , will you kneel with me , and you , ? if one of us be hit let another take his place at once . now be ready , for they be come ! " as he speak there be a shrill whistle from below , and in an instant the stair be fill with rush red figure and wave weapon . bang ! bang ! ! go the three gun , and then again and again ! bang ! bang ! the smoke be so thick in the room that they could hardly see to pass the musket to the eager hand which grasp for them . but no have reach the barricade , and there be no patter of their foot now upon the stair . nothing but an angry snarl and an occasional groan from below . the marksman be , but they cease to fire and wait for the smoke to clear . and when it clear they see how deadly their aim have be at those close quarter . only nine shot have be fire , and seven indian be litter up and down on the straight stone stair . five of them lie motionless , but two try to crawl slowly back to their friend . and the raise their musket , and the two crippled man lie still . " by ! " say the old pioneer , as he ram home another bullet . " if they have our scalp we have sell them at a great price . a hundred squaw will be howl in their village when they hear of this day 's work . " " ay , they will not forget their welcome at , " say the old nobleman . " i must again express my deep regret , my dear , that you and your wife should have be put to such inconvenience when you have be good enough to visit me . i trust that she and the other be safe at the fort by this time . " " grant that they be ! oh , i shall never have an easy moment until i see her once more . " " if they be safe we may expect help in the morning , if we can hold out so long . , the commandant , be not a man to leave a comrade at a pinch . " the card be still lay out at one end of the table , with the trick overlap each other , as they have leave them on the previous morning . but there be something else there of more interest to them , for the breakfast have not be clear away , and they have be fight all day with hardly bite or sup . even when face to face with death , still cry out for her due , and the hungry man turn savagely upon the loaf , the ham , and the cold wild duck . a little cluster of wine bottle stand upon the buffet , and these have their neck knock off , and be empty down parched throat . three man still take their turn , however , to hold the barricade , for they be not to be catch nap again . the yell and screech of the savage come up to them as though all the wolf of the forest be coop up in the basement , but the stair be desert save for the seven motionless figure . " they will not try to rush us again , " say with confidence . " we have teach them too severe a lesson . " " they will set fire to the house . " " it will puzzle them to do that , " say the major-domo . " it be solid stone , wall and stair , save only for a few beam of wood , very different from those other cottage . " " ! " cry , and raise his hand . the yell have die away , and they hear the heavy thud of a mallet beating upon wood . " what can it be ? " " some fresh devilry , no doubt . " " i regret to say , monsieur , " observe the seigneur , with no abatement of his courtly manner , " that it be my belief that they have learn a lesson from our young friend here , and that they be knock out the head of the in the . " but shake his head at the suggestion . " it be not in a to waste powder , " say he . " it be a deal too precious for them to do that . ah , listen to that ! " the and have begin again , but there be a wild , mad ring in their shrillness , and they be mingle with snatch of song and burst of laughter . " ! it be the brandy cask which they have open , " cry . " they be bad before , but they will be fiend out of hell now . " as he speak there come another burst of whoop , and high above them a voice call for mercy . with horror in their eye the survivor glance from one to the other . a heavy smell of burning flesh rise from below , and still that dreadful voice shriek and plead . then slowly it quaver away and be silent forever . " who be it ? " whisper , his blood run cold in his vein . " it be , i think . " " rest his soul ! his trouble be over . would that we be as peaceful as he ! ah , shoot him ! shoot ! " a man have suddenly spring out at the foot of the stair and have swing his arm as though throw something . it be the flemish . 's musket flash , but the savage have spring back again as rapidly as he appear . something splash down amongst them and roll across the floor in the . " down ! down ! it be a bomb ! " cry but it lie at 's foot , and he have see it clearly . he take a cloth from the table and drop it over it . " it be not a bomb , " say he quietly , " and it be who die . " for four hour sound of riot , of dancing and of revel rise up from the store-house , and the smell of the open brandy cask fill the whole air . more than once the savage quarrel and fight among themselves , and it seem as if they have forget their enemy above , but the besiege soon find that if they attempt to presume upon this they be as closely watch as ever . the major-domo , , pass between a and a light , be kill instantly by a bullet from the stockade , and both and the old seigneur have narrow escape until they block all the window save that which overlook the river . there be no danger from this one , and , as day be already break once more , one or other of the party be forever strain their eye down the stream in search of the expect succour . slowly the light creep up the eastern sky , a little line of pearl , then a band of pink , broaden , stretch , spread , until it shoot its warm colour across the heaven , ting the edge of the drift cloud . over the woodland lie a thin gray vapour , the top of the high oak jut out like dim island from the sea of haze . gradually as the light increase the mist shred off into little ragged wisp , which thin and drift away , until at last , as the sun push its glowing edge over the eastern forest , it gleam upon the red and orange and purple of the fading leave , and upon the broad blue river which curl away to the northward . , as he stand at the window look out , be breathe in the healthy resinous scent of the tree , mingle with the damp heavy odour of the wet earth , when suddenly his eye fall upon a dark spot upon the river to the north of them . " there be a canoe come down ! " he cry . in an instant they have all rush to the opening , but spring after them , and pull them angrily towards the door . " do you wish to die before your time ? " he cry . " ay , ay ! " say , who understand the gesture if not the word . " we must leave a watch on deck . , lad , lie here with me and be ready if they show . " the two and the old pioneer hold the barricade , while the eye of all the other be turn upon the approach boat . a groan break suddenly from the only survive " it be an iroquois canoe ! " he cry . " impossible ! " " alas , your excellency , it be so , and it be the same one which pass us last night . " " ah , then the woman have escape them . " " i trust so . but alas , seigneur , i fear that there be more in the canoe now than when they pass us . " the little group of survivor wait in breathless anxiety while the canoe speed swiftly up the river , with a line of foam on either side of her , and a long forked swirl in the water behind . they could see that she appear to be very crowd , but they remember that the wounded of the other boat be aboard her . on she shoot and on , until as she come abreast of the fort she swing round , and the rower raise their paddle and burst into a shrill yell of derision . the stern of the canoe be turn towards them now , and they see that two woman be seat in it . even at that distance there be no mistake the sweet pale face or the dark queenly one beside it . the one be and the other be . de la , , be a hard and self-contained man , but a groan and a bitter curse burst from him when he see his indian wife in the hand of her kinsman , from whom she could hope for little mercy . yet even now his old-fashioned courtesy to his guest have make him turn to with some word of sympathy , when there be a clatter of wood , something darken the light of the window , and the young soldier be go . without a word he have lower the ladder and be clamber down it with frantic haste . then as his foot touch the ground he signal to his comrade to draw it up again , and dash into the river he swim towards the canoe . without arm and without a plan he have but the one think that his place be by the side of his wife in this , the hour of her danger . fate should bring him what it bring her , and he swear to himself , as he cleave a way with his strong arm , that whether it be life or death they should still share it together . but there be another whose view of duty lead him from safety into the face of danger . all night the franciscan have watch as a miser watch his treasure , fill with the thought that this heretic be the one little seed which might spread and spread until it choke the choose vineyard of the . now when he see him rush so suddenly down the ladder , every fear be banish from his mind save the overpowering one that he be about to lose his precious charge . he , too , clamber down at the very heel of his prisoner , and rush into the stream not ten pace behind him . and so the watcher at the window see the strange of sight . there , in , lie the canoe , with a ring of dark warrior cluster in the stern , and the two woman crouch in the midst of them . swim madly towards them be , rise to the shoulder with the strength of every stroke , and behind him again be the tonsured head of the friar , with his brown capote and long trail gown float upon the surface of the water behind him . but in his zeal he have think too little of his own power . he be a good swimmer , but he be weight and hamper by his unwieldy clothes . slow and slow grow his stroke , lower and lower his head , until at last with a great shriek of in manus , ! he throw up his hand , and vanish in the swirl of the river . a minute later the watcher , hoarse with scream to him to return , see pull aboard the iroquois canoe , which be instantly turn and continue its course up the river . " ! " cry hoarsely . " they have take him . he be lose . " " i have see some strange thing in these forty year , but never the like of that ! " say . the seigneur take a little pinch of snuff from his gold box , and flick the wander grain from his shirt-front with his dainty lace handkerchief . " monsieur have act like a gentleman of , " say he . " if i could swim now as i do thirty year ago , i should be by his side . " glance round him and shake his head . " we be only six now , " say he . " i fear they be up to some devilry because they be so very still . " " they be leave the house ! " cry the , who be peep through one of the side window . " what can it mean ? , be it possible that we be save ? see how they throng through the tree . they be make for the canoe . now they be wave their arm and point . " " there be the gray hat of that mongrel devil amongst them , " say the captain . " i would try a shot upon him be it not a waste of powder and lead . " " i have hit the mark at as long a range , " say , push his long brown gun through a chink in the barricade which they have throw across the low half of the window . " i would give my next year 's trade to bring him down . " " it be forty pace further than my musket would carry , " remark , " but i have see the english shoot a great way with those long gun . " take a steady aim , rest his gun upon the window sill , and fire . a shout of delight burst from the little knot of survivor . the flemish have fall . but he be on his foot again in an instant and shake his hand defiantly at the window . " curse it ! " cry bitterly , in . " i have hit him with a spend ball . as well strike him with a pebble . " " , curse not , , lad , but try him again with another pinch of powder if your gun will stand it . " the woodsman thrust in a full charge , and choose a well-rounded bullet from his bag , but when he look again both the and his warrior have disappear . on the river the single iroquois canoe which hold the captive be speed south as swiftly as twenty paddle could drive it , but save this one dark streak upon the blue stream , not a sign be to be see of their enemy . they have vanish as if they have be an evil dream . there be the stockade , the litter of dead body inside it , the burned and roofless cottage , but the silent wood lie gleam in the morning sunshine as quiet and peaceful as if no of fiend have ever break out from them . " by my faith , i believe that they have go ! " cry the seigneur . " take care that it be not a ruse , " say . " why should they fly before six man when they have conquer sixty ? " but the have look out of the other window , and in an instant he be down upon his knee with his hand in the air , and his powder blacken face turn upwards , patter out prayer and thanksgiving . his five comrade rush across the room and burst into a shriek of joy . the upper reach of the river be cover with a flotilla of canoe from which the sun strike quick flash as it shine upon the and trapping of the crew . already they could see the white coat of the regular , the brown tunic of the , and the gaudy colour of the and . on they sweep , dot the whole breadth of the river , and grow large every instant , while far away on the southern bend , the iroquois canoe be a mere move dot which have shoot away to the farther side and lose itself presently under the shadow of the tree . another minute and the survivor be out upon the bank , wave their cap in the air , while the prow of the first of their rescuer be already grate upon the pebble . in the stern of the very foremost canoe sit a wizened little man with a large brown wig , and a rapier lay across his knee . he spring out as the keel touch bottom , splash through the shallow water with his high leather boot , and rush up to the seigneur , he fling himself into his arm . " my dear , " he cry , " you have hold your house like a hero . what , only six of you ! tut , tut , this have be a bloody business ! " " i know that you would not desert a comrade , . we have save the house , but our loss have be terrible . my son be dead . my wife be in that iroquois canoe in front of you . " the commandant of press his friend 's hand in silent sympathy . " the other arrive all safe , " he say at last . " only that one be take , on account of the breaking of a paddle . three be drown and two capture . there be a french lady in it , i understand , as well as madame . " " yes , and they have take her husband as well . " " ah , poor soul ! well , if you be strong enough to join us , you and your friend , we shall follow after them without the loss of an instant . ten of my man will remain to guard the house , and you can have their canoe . jump in then , and forward , for life and death may hang upon our speed ! " the have not treat harshly when they drag him from the water into their canoe . so incomprehensible be it to them why any man should voluntarily leave a place of safety in order to put himself in their power that they could only set it down to madness , a malady which inspire awe and respect among the . they do not even tie his wrist , for why should he attempt to escape when he have come of his own free will ? two warrior pass their hand over him , to be sure that he be unarm , and he be then thrust down between the two woman , while the canoe dart in towards the bank to tell the other that the garrison be come up the stream . then it steer out again , and make its way swiftly up the centre of the river . be deadly pale and her hand , as her husband lay his upon it , be as cold as marble . " my darling , " he whisper , " tell me that all be well with you be unhurt ! " " oh , , why do you come ? why do you come , ? oh , i think i could have bear anything , but if they hurt you i could not bear that . " " how could i stay behind when i know that you be in their hand ? i should have go mad ! " " ah , it be my one consolation to think that you be safe . " " no , no , we have go through so much together that we can part now . what be death , ? why should we be afraid of it ? " " i be not afraid of it . " " and i be not afraid of it . thing will come about as will it , and what he will must in the end be the good . if we live , then we have this memory in common . if we die , then we go hand-in-hand into another life . courage , my own , all will be well with us . " " tell me , monsieur , " say , " be my lord still live ? " " yes , he be alive and well . " " it be good . he be a great chief , and i have never be sorry , not even now , that i have wed with one who be not of my own people . but , my son ! who shall give my son back to me ? he be like the young sapling , so straight and so strong ! who could run with him , or leap with him , or swim with him ? ere that sun shine again we shall all be dead , and my heart be glad , for i shall see my boy once more . " the iroquois paddle have bend to their work until a good ten mile lie between them and . then they run the canoe into a little creek upon their own side of the river , and spring out of her , drag the prisoner after them . the canoe be carry on the shoulder of eight man some distance into the wood , where they conceal it between two fallen tree , heap a litter of branch over it to screen it from view . then , after a short council , they start through the forest , walk in single file , with their three prisoner in the middle . there be fifteen warrior in all , eight in front and seven behind , all arm with musket and as as deer , so that escape be out of the question . they could but follow on , and wait in patience for whatever might befall them . all day they pursue their dreary march , pick their way through vast morass , skirt the border of blue woodland lake where the gray stork flap heavily up from the reed at their approach , or plunge into dark belt of woodland where it be always twilight , and where the fall of the wild chestnut and the chatter of the squirrels a hundred foot above their head be the only sound which break the silence . have the endurance of the themselves , but , in spite of her former journey , be footsore and weary before evening . it be a relief to , therefore , when the red glow of a great fire beat suddenly through the , and they come upon an indian camp in which be assemble the great part of the which have be drive from . here , too , be a number of the squaw who have come from the mohawk and village in order to be near to the warrior . wigwam have be erect all round in a circle , and before each of them be the fire with kettle sling upon a tripod of stick in which the evening meal be be cook . in the centre of all be a very fierce fire which have be make of brushwood place in a circle , so as to leave a clear space of twelve foot in the middle . a pole stand up in the centre of this clearing , and something all mottle with red and black be tie up against it . step swiftly in front of that she might not see the dreadful thing , but he be too late . she shudder , and draw a quick breath between her pale lip , but no sound escape her . " they have begin already , then , " say composedly . " well , it will be our turn next , and we shall show them that we know how to die . " " they have not ill-use us yet , " say . " perhaps they will keep us for ransom or exchange . " the indian woman shake her head . " do not deceive yourself by any such hope , " say she . " when they be as gentle as they have be with you it be ever a sign that you be reserve for the torture . your wife will be marry to one of their chief , but you and i must die , for you be a warrior , and i be too old for a squaw . " marry to an ! those dreadful word shoot a pang through both their heart which no think of death could have do . 's head drop forward upon his chest , and he stagger and would have fall have not catch him by the arm . " do not fear , dear , " she whisper . " other thing may happen but not that , for i swear to you that i shall not survive you . no , it may be sin or it may not , but if death will not come to me , i will go to it . " look down at the gentle face which have set now into the hard line of an immutable resolve . he know that it would be as she have say , and that , come what might , that last outrage would not befall them . could he ever have believe that the time would come when it would send a thrill of joy through his heart to know that his wife would die ? as they enter the iroquois village the squaw and warrior have rush towards them , and they pass through a double line of hideous face which jeer and jibe and howl at them as they pass . their escort lead them through this rabble and conduct them to a hut which stand apart . it be empty , save for some willow hang at the side , and a heap of pumpkin store in the corner . " the chief will come and will decide upon what be to be do with us , " say . " here they be come now , and you will soon see that i be right , for i know the way of my own people . " an instant later an old , accompany by two young brave and by the bearded iroquois who have lead the attack upon the manor-house , stroll over and stand in the doorway , look in at the prisoner , and shoot little guttural sentence at each other . the totem of the , the , the , and the show that they each represent one of the great family of the nation . the be smoke a stone pipe , and yet it be he who talk the most , argue apparently with one of the young savage , who seem to come round at last to his opinion . finally the old chief say a few short stern word , and the matter appear to be settle . " and you , you beldame , " say the in to the iroquois woman , " you will have a lesson this night which will teach you to side against your own people . " " you mongrel , " reply the fearless old woman , " you should take that hat from your head when you speak to one in whose vein run the good blood of the . you a warrior ? you who , with a thousand at your back , could not make your way into a little house with a few poor husbandman within it ! it be no wonder that your father 's people have cast you out ! go back and work at the bead , or play at the game of , for some day in the wood you might meet with a man , and so bring disgrace upon the nation which have take you in ! " the evil face of the grow livid as he listen to the scornful word which be hiss at him by the captive . he stride across to her , and take her hand he thrust her forefinger into the burning bowl of his pipe . she make no effort to remove it , but sit with a perfectly set face for a minute or more , look out through the open door at the evening sunlight and the little group of chatter indian . he have watch her keenly in the hope of hear a cry , or see some spasm of agony upon her face , but at last , with a curse , he dash down her hand and stride from the hut . she thrust her char finger into her bosom and laugh . " he be a ! " she cry . " he do not even know how to torture . now , i could have get a cry out of him . i be sure of it . but , you be very white ! " " it be the sight of such a hellish deed . ah , if we be but set face to face , i with my sword , he with what weapon he choose , by , he should pay for it with his heart 's blood . " the indian woman seem surprised . " it be strange to me , " she say , " that you should think of what befall me when you be under the same shadow . but our fate will be as i say . " " ah ! " " you and i be to die at the stake . she be to be give to the dog who have leave us . " " ah ! " " ! ! what shall i do ! " he tear his hair in his helplessness and distraction . " no , no , fear not , , for my heart will not fail me . what be the pang of death if it bind us together ? " " the young chief plead for you , say that the have strike you with madness , as could be see by your swimming to their canoe , and that a blight would fall upon the nation if you be lead to the stake . but this say that love come often like madness among the pale-face , and that it be that alone which have drive you . then it be agree that you should die and that she should go to his wigwam , since he have lead the . as for me , their heart be bitter against me , and i also be to die by the pine splinter . " breathe a prayer that he might meet his fate like a soldier and a gentleman . " when be it to be ? " he ask . " now ! at once ! they have go to make all ready ! but you have time yet , for i be to go first . " " , , could we not die together now ? " cry , throw her arm round her husband . " if it be sin , it be surely a sin which will be forgive us . let us go , dear . let us leave these dreadful people and this cruel world and turn where we shall find peace . " the indian woman 's eye flash with satisfaction . " you have speak well , , " say she . " why should you wait until it be their pleasure to pluck you . see , already the glare of their fire beat upon the , and you can hear the of those who thirst for your blood . if you die by your own hand , they will be rob of their spectacle , and their chief will have lose his bride . so you will be the victor in the end , and they the vanquish . you have say rightly , . there lie the only path for you ! " " but how to take it ? " glance keenly at the two warrior who stand as sentinel at the door of the hut . they have turn away , absorb in the horrible preparation which be go on . then she rummage deeply within the fold of her loose gown and pull out a small pistol with two brass barrel and double trigger in the form of wing dragon . it be only a toy to look at , all carve and scroll and grave with the choicest work of the gunsmith . for its beauty the seigneur have buy it at his last visit to , and yet it might be useful , too , and it be load in both barrel . " i mean to use it on myself , " say she , as she slip it into the hand of . " but now i be mind to show them that i can die as an should die , and that i be worthy to have the blood of their chief in my vein . take it , for i swear that i will not use it myself , unless it be to fire both bullet into that 's heart . " a flush of joy shot over as his finger close round the pistol . here be indeed a key to unlock the gate of peace . lay her cheek against his shoulder and laugh with pleasure . " you will forgive me , dear , " he whisper . " forgive you ! i bless you , and love you with my whole heart and soul . clasp me close , darling , and say one prayer before you do it . " they have sink on their knee together when three warrior enter the hut and say a few abrupt word to their . she rise with a smile . " they be wait for me , " say she . " you shall see , , and you also , monsieur , how well i know what be due to my position . farewell , and remember ! " she smile again , and walk from the hut amidst the warrior with the quick firm step of a queen who sweep to a throne . " now , ! " whisper , close her eye , and nestle still closer to him . he raise the pistol , and then , with a quick sudden of the breath , he drop it , and kneel with glaring eye look up at a tree which face the open door of the hut . it be a , exceedingly old and gnarled , with its bark hang down in strip and its whole trunk spot with moss and mould . some ten foot above the ground the main trunk divide into two , and in the fork thus form a hand have suddenly appear , a large reddish hand , which shake frantically from side to side in passionate dissuasion . the next instant , as the two captive still stare in amazement , the hand disappear behind the trunk again and a face appear in its place , which still shake from side to side as resolutely as its forerunner . it be impossible to mistake that mahogany , wrinkle skin , the huge bristle eyebrow , or the little glisten eye . it be of ! and even as they stare and wonder a sudden shrill whistle burst out from the depth of the forest , and in a moment every bush and thicket and patch of brushwood be spout fire and smoke , while the snarl of the musketry run round the whole glade , and the storm of bullet whizz and pelt among the yell savage . the ' sentinel have be draw in by their bloodthirsty craving to see the prisoner die , and now the canadian be upon them , and they be hem in by a ring of fire . first one way and then another they rush , to be meet always by the same blast of death , until find at last some gap in the attack they stream through , like sheep through a break fence , and rush madly away through the forest , with the bullet of their pursuer still sing about their ear , until the whistle sound again to recall the woodsman from the chase . but there be one savage who have find work to do before he flee . the flemish have prefer his vengeance to his safety ! rush at , he bury his tomahawk in her brain , and then , yell his war-cry , he wave the blood-stained weapon above his head , and fly into the hut where the prisoner still kneel . see him come , and a mad joy glisten in his eye . he rise to meet him , and as he rush in he fire both barrel of his pistol into the 's face . an instant later a swarm of canadian have rush over the writhe body , the captive feel warm friendly hand which grasp their own , and look upon the smile , well-known face of , , and , they know that peace have come to them at last . and so the refugee come to the end of the toil of their journey , for that winter be spend by them in peace at , and in the spring , the have carry the war to the , the traveller be able to descend into the english province , and so to make their way down the to , where a warm welcome await them from the family of . the friendship between the two man be now so cement together by common memory and common danger that they soon become partner in , and the name of the frenchman come at last to be as familiar in the mountain of and on the slope of the as it have once be in the salon and corridor of . in time build a house on , where many of his have settle , and much of what he win from his be spend in the endeavour to help his struggle huguenot brother . have marry a dutch maiden of , and as and she become inseparable friend , the marriage serve to draw close the ty of love which hold the two family together . as to , he return safely to his beloved , where he fulfill his ambition by build himself a fair brick house upon the rise ground in the northern part of the city , whence he could look down both upon the shipping in the river and the bay . there he live , much respect by his townsfolk , who make him selectman and alderman , and give him the command of a goodly ship when make his attack upon , and find that the old be not to be drive from his lair . so , honour by all , the old seaman live to an age which carry him deep into the next century , when he could already see with his dim eye something of the grow greatness of his country . the manor-house of be soon restore to its former prosperity , but its seigneur be from the day that he lose his wife and son a changed man . he grow lean , fierce , less human , forever head party which make their way into the iroquois wood and which outrival the savage themselves in the terrible nature of their deed . a day come at last when he sally out upon one of these expedition , from which neither he nor any of his man ever return . many a terrible secret be hide by those silent wood , and the fate of , , be among them . towards the latter quarter of the seventeenth century there be hardly an important industry in which be not control by the huguenot , so that , numerous as they be , their importance be out of all proportion to their number . the cloth trade of the north and the , the manufacture of serge and light stuff in , the linen trade of and , the silk and velvet industry of and , the glass of , the paper of auvergne and , the jewellery of the of , the tan yard of , the iron and tin work of the these be largely own and manage by huguenot . the numerous day of the handicap their rival , and it be compute that the protestant work @card@ day in the year to his 's @card@ . a very large number of the huguenot refugee be bring back , and the jail and galley of be crowd with them . one hundred thousand settle in and , @card@ in , @card@ in , and @card@ in . some make their way even to the distant of , where they remain in the district . in war , as in industry , the exile be a source of strength to the country which receive them . frenchman drill the russian army of the , a huguenot become commander-in-chief in , and lead the army of , and afterwards that of . in three huguenot regiment be form for the service of . the exile establish themselves as silk worker in , cotton spinner at , tapestry weaver at , wool carder at , kersey maker at , weaver at , bat maker at , sailcloth maker at , worker in calico in , glass in , paper at , cambric at . early protestant refugee have take refuge in twenty year before the revocation , where they form a colony at . a body come to in @card@ , and be give @card@ acre at , by order of the at . in and colony spring up , and later in ( the monacan ) , in , and in ( and quarter ) . it have be leave to our own century to clear the fair fame of madame of all reproach , and to show her as what she be , a pure woman and a devoted wife . she have receive little justice from the memoir writer of the seventeenth century , most of whom , the , for example , and the of , have their own private reason for dislike her . an admirable epitome of her character and influence will be find in 's historical study . she make an excellent wife , wait upon him assiduously for thirty year of married life , influence him constantly towards only in the one instance of the huguenot , and finally die very shortly after her husband . madame live in great magnificence after the triumph of her rival , and spend freely the vast sum which the king 's generosity have furnish her with . eventually , have exhaust all that this world could offer , she take to hair-shirt and girdle , in the hope of secure a good position in the next . her horror of death be excessive . in thunderstorm she sit with a little child in her lap , in the hope that its innocence might shield her from the lightning . she sleep always with her room ablaze with taper , and with several woman watch by the side of her couch . when at last the inevitable arrive she leave her body for the family tomb , her heart to the convent of , and her entrails to the priory of near . these latter be thrust into a box and give to a peasant to convey to the priory . curiosity induce him to look into the box upon the way , and , see the content , he suppose himself to be the victim of a practical joke , and empty them out into a ditch . a swineherd be pass at the moment with his pig , and so it happen that , in the word of , " in a few minute the most filthy animal in creation have devour portion of the remain of one of the haughty woman who ever tread the earth . " , after a reign of more than fifty year , which comprise the most brilliant epoch of french history , die at last in @card@ amidst the sad surroundings . one by one those whom he love have precede him to the grave , his brother , his son , the two son of his son , their wife , and finally his favourite great-grandson , until he , the old die monarch , with his rouge and his stays , be leave with only a little infant in arm , the , three generation away from him , to perpetuate his line . on 20th , @card@ , he be attack by senile gangrene , which gradually spread up the leg until on the 30th it become fatal . his die word be worthy of his good self . " gentleman , i desire your pardon for the bad example which i have set you . i have greatly to thank you fur the manner in which you have serve me , as well as for the attachment and fidelity which i have always experience at your hand . i request from you the same zeal and fidelity for my grandson . farewell , gentleman . i feel that this parting have affect not only myself but you also . forgive me ! i trust that you will sometimes think of me when i be go .
